Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

Executive summary
Despite the significant impact of goods movement on the road system and on the economy, there is a
need to raise awareness and understanding of how goods are transported in urban areas and how to
best plan for goods movement. There is a widely acknowledged gap in the training and education of
urban and transportation planners, engineers, and other professionals on the subject of goods
movement. Sharing best practices and learning how to best engage the goods movement industry in
planning, engineering and policy development would benefit many professionals and help them
anticipate future trends. It would also enhance understanding of the issues that have an impact on the
industry and how they interface with the needs of other road users as well as how innovative
approaches can address those issues.
The goals of this work are to provide the following knowledge of goods movement to transportation
practitioners:
•

Tools for goods movement planning – including an understanding of concepts, data and
analytical skills

•

Tools for interacting with goods movement stakeholders

•

Goods movement planning best practices

Although this course is targeted primarily towards transportation planning staff at various government
agencies, it may also be relevant to other transportation professionals, as well as staff and officials from
other industries and public sectors. This course will allow for the development of a basic understanding
of the planning considerations related to goods movement, and considers how aspects of goods
movement will vary between urban, rural and inter-city scales, as well as the multimodal aspects of
goods movement. Consideration is given to readers who have different technical or non-technical roles
in their respective organizations, resulting in an audience with varied knowledge. Consideration is also
given to how goods movement varies between urban, rural and intercity scales, as well as its multimodal
aspects.
The course is structured to encourage engagement and knowledge sharing between participants. It
includes three modules to help the audience develop a broad understanding of goods movement:
•

Module 1: Freight Industry Overview – an overview of the goods movement industry in Canada,
discussing its structure, the stakeholders involved and their responsibilities, the different modes
available and their characteristics, and an introduction to supply chains

•

Module 2: Planning Considerations – an introduction to a range of considerations made by
governments and freight-related companies when planning, implementing, and evaluating
projects

•

Module 3: Trends and Disruptors – a presentation of emerging social, industry, and
technological trends and advancements in the goods movement industry, and a discussion of
the benefits they bring and the potential risks associated

It also includes a number of case studies and self-directed exercises that apply concepts learned and
share best practices from other Canadian and international jurisdictions, including supply chains,
urbanization and land use planning, and policy-making.

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

Module 1: Freight industry overview
This module provides a general overview of the freight industry, its structure, the major players involved
and their responsibilities, and different modes. By the end of this module, the reader will better
understand:
•

The evolution, purpose, and dynamics of goods movement in Canada, as well as the economic
drivers and infrastructure that shape Canada’s national and global trade

•

The different modes available for transporting specific goods, and trade-offs in selecting modes

•

The different actors and industries that participate in goods movement, and the responsibilities
of different levels of government with regards to goods movement

•

The basic workings of a supply chain

Summary Points
•

Three main corridors serve as the backbone of Canada’s trade: The Western Asia-Pacific
Corridor, the Ontario-Quebec Corridor, and the Atlantic Corridor.

•

Canada has over 1.13 million two-lane equivalent lane-kilometres of public roads, 81 airports,
41,700 route-kilometres of rail track, and 559 marine port facilities.

•

There are many factors that are generally considered when choosing a shipment mode, such as
time and cost of shipping, availability of services, and legal and insurance considerations.
Furthermore, there are several actors, from shipper and logistics providers to government
agencies that participate in the shipment of goods.

•

The basic premise of a supply chain involves moving supplies from a place of origin to a place of
production, processing, warehousing, or distribution, and then to a place of consumption. In
urban settings, goods movement takes place through one of three main channels: industrial
production, retail distribution, or service provision.

Module 2: Planning considerations
This module introduces the audience to a range of considerations made by both governments and
freight companies. Considerations should be made for selecting their projects and their components,
how projects are evaluated, what data is available to use in planning, and freight sensitive strategies
that are available for planners with regards to goods movement infrastructure. By the end of this
module, the reader will better understand:
•

The dynamics and components of project planning, as well as some of the considerations that
should be made for freight when planning projects

•

The means and tools available for data collection and management, including common sources
of data, stakeholder consultation, and analyzing current and future needs

•

Strategies for project planning that are freight-supportive, as well as an exploration into road
and site design, and freight-inclusive demand modelling

•

How to effectively evaluate a potential project to ensure it will provide the desired outcomes

Summary Points
•

environment. It starts by identifying problems, goals and objectives, and the required
information to be analyzed.
•

Data collection involves four primary types and sources of data: quantitative data, intelligence
gathering and stakeholder consultation, site visits, and freight data. Part of the planning process
also involves analyzing current and future trends, which includes a look at freight supply and
demand, infrastructure, regulation and policy, enforcement, and future needs.

•

There are many freight-supportive strategies available for various project undertakings, such as
the development and identification of arterial and secondary routes; protecting corridors and
employment lands through zoning by-laws or municipal plans; and building truck bypasses and
parking facilities into current road networks.

•

There are a wide range of tools that exist to evaluate the potential benefits of proposals, and
the method selected depends on the stakeholder performing the assessment. The majority of
available tools fall under three main categories: cost-benefit analysis, risk analysis, or SWOT
analysis.

Module 3: Trends and disruptors
This module presents the results of research of emerging social, industry, and technological trends and
potential risks in the goods movement industry. The overall purpose is to educate the audience on
recent developments in the industry that they should be aware of, and have the potential to take
advantage of, when planning and delivering projects. It is also meant to educate the audience on what
the current and emerging trends exist within freight to raise awareness of how and why certain
companies make their decisions. By the end of this module, the reader will better understand:
•

Disruptors inducing the shifting behaviours of freight industry stakeholders, policymakers, and
consumers, and their impacts on production, distribution, delivery and consumption

•

Technological advancements that can be deployed throughout the freight industry, and the
benefits, risks, and practical limitations that are associated with them

•

Other external forces that may bring about risks and challenges to the freight industry

Summary Points
•

Significant changes to consumer purchasing options (e.g. e-commerce and on-demand delivery
services); the shift in culture towards recycling and returns; social and public involvement
towards transportation investments; and the changing nature of freight logistics, infrastructure,
and ownership are all emerging trends that have changed the freight and transport landscape.

•

Additionally, advancements in technologies such as automation, intelligent transportation
systems, and alternative fuels can lead to great opportunities to improve safety and efficiency,
but come with significant risks and practical limitations. The limited adoption and scale today
could mean that some of these technologies may not be realized in their full forms in the future.

•

There are other risks that should be considered for freight, such as the infrastructure gap, an
aging workforce, security, and policies surrounding cross-border freight traffic.

Case studies
This section presents four case studies that present real-world examples of goods movement-related
activities, and that will help the reader to better understand:
•

The dynamics and components of a supply chain through a case study of Apple’s iPad

•

How project planning is used, through exploring the development of Winnipeg’s freight village,
CentrePort

•

How goods movement was incorporated into policy-making through MTO’s off-peak delivery

Module 1: Freight industry overview

This module provides a general overview of the freight industry, its structure, the major players involved
and their responsibilities, and its different modes. Its major sections are:
•

Canadian context

•

Modal profiles

•

Definition of actors

•

Industry and commodity profiles

•

Understanding supply chains

Key takeaways from this section include why companies select certain modes to transport specific
goods, the responsibilities of different levels of government with regards to goods movement, and the
basic workings of a supply chain.

1.1

Canadian context

1.1.1

Background information

Goods movement, or freight, is broadly defined as the wide array of activities involved in transporting
goods (primary, intermediate, or finished) from producer/supplier to consumer. It is a derived demand
driven by consumption and commerce. In other words, the demand for goods movement is a result of
the demand for other goods. 1 Therefore, as demand for these goods increases, the demand for their
transport will also increase. Goods can travel along a supply chain by one mode or a combination of
them, including road, rail, marine, air and pipeline. Section 1.2 in this module has modal profiles that
describe transport needs and characteristics by road, rail, air and marine. Section 1.4 contains industry
and commodity profiles that describe the characteristics of the modes, goods they typically transport,
and environmental considerations.
The Canadian goods movement sector encompasses various other sectors and subsectors – as classified
by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) – including construction, manufacturing,
and wholesale trade for example, while also interacting and providing transport services for a wide
range of economic sectors that produce goods. Industries that fall within the sphere of goods movement
include logistics, manufacturing and its specific types (e.g. animal food manufacturing), warehousing and
storage, and various transportation industries such as rail, water and air transportation, and trucking. 2
These industries must effectively coordinate with each other (locally, nationally and internationally)
along with producers, suppliers, consumers and government(s) in order to complete supply chains. The
complex nature of supply chains is further described in Section 1.5.
Goods movement has always been an important part of the Canadian economy, and has been facilitated
through the introduction of new technologies, methods and materials over time. One such example is
the introduction of shipping containers in the 1950s. Containerization is the use of a single standard-size
cargo container to load, transport and unload goods. 3 The containers are easily transloaded (transferred
intermodally by crane from ships to trains or trucks, or vice-versa), and are typically unloaded and
refitted into smaller standardized cargo units for air transport. Prior to the introduction of
February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

containerization, the unloading of ships at docks would take many labourers to complete, and generally
required factories and intermodal facilities to be located near ports to facilitate land transportation. This
was because most cargo prior to this time was transported in the form of bulk or break bulk. Bulk cargo
(also known as general cargo) is a form of large, unpackaged commodity cargo that can be liquid or dry
(e.g. crude oil or gravel). The cargo is typically poured or dropped directly into the receptacle used for its
transport. 4 Break bulk cargo refers to goods that are loaded/unloaded individually and are typically
stored in bags, boxes, crates, drums or barrels for transport (e.g. bagged cement, steel coil, oil and gas
equipment). 5
After the introduction of the shipping container, the method, frequency and cost of shipping goods
locally, regionally and globally changed significantly. 6 The standardization of container size allowed for
factories to relocate away from ports, towards smaller towns with cheaper land and lower wages, as
they no longer needed to be located near ports to benefit from cheap transportation. This brought
about the beginning of large industrial complexes in rural areas where there is more space to store
goods. It also brought the development of international manufacturing companies with networks of
warehouses or distribution centres, allowing firms to select the cheapest location to assemble and ship
goods to market, which helped accelerate a change in the international economy towards the
intensification of global trade.
As a result of the introduction of containerization to the shipping industry, as well as the development
of free trade agreements (FTA) and other technological advancements, transportation and
warehousing 7 have continued to increase as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), and
accounted for 4.6% of Canadian GDP in 2017, while employing 905,000 individuals. 8 This sector is
important to the overall health of the Canadian economy due to the abundance of natural resources
within the country and access to global markets through ports in Atlantic and Pacific provinces. Overall,
much of the resources and goods produced within Canada are eventually packaged and shipped
internationally (with the United States accounting for 63% of total Canadian trade in 2017); however, a
portion remains in Canada.
Finally, there are several current and planned government initiatives that may impact freight industry
stakeholders. The roles and responsibilities of different levels of government are further described in
Section 1.3 below. At the federal level, planners can look to Transport Canada for initiatives,
consultations, and laws and regulations that affect the transportation sector, including the goods
movement industry. For example, Transportation 2030 provides a strategic plan to make Canada’s
transportation system smarter, cleaner, and safer, with a focus on waterways and trade corridors to
global markets. There is also the National Trade Corridors Fund (NTCF) which provides funding for
strategic infrastructure projects that support the flow of goods and trade diversification, address unique
transportation needs in the territorial North, and increase the flow of Canadian trade by all modes for
example. Finally, a recent development is Bill C-49, or the Transportation Modernization Act, which
affects rail and air transportation primarily. In part, the Bill seeks to increase transparency related to
railway companies publishing tariff data and reporting information to the Minister of Transport,
providing dispute resolution tools for shippers to hold railways accountable for their commitments to
move products to markets, and requiring the Canadian Transportation Agency to set the interswitching
rate. 9
At the provincial level there are strategic plans, typically addressing horizons of five to ten years, that
are released by some provinces or one of their ministries and affect the movement of goods within the
provincial transportation system. These documents provide planned spending which can help planners

2

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

understand what other projects are taking place within a province, or decide which projects to pursue
based on where funding is allocated, if not already earmarked for a specific project. For example, the
current Manitoba Capital Region Transportation Plan includes a section on goods movement; Nova
Scotia’s Five-Year Highway Improvement Plan 2018-2019 outlines current and planned projects up to
2023; British Columbia’s Ten-Year Transportation Plan acts as a comprehensive road map for
transportation investments and strategic policy actions; and Newfoundland and Labrador’s Five-Year
Provincial Roads Plan acts as a holistic and proactive plan to ensure the condition and longevity of
transportation infrastructure.
At the municipal level, the majority of goods movement strategies, if any, can be found in transportation
master plans where land uses, transport infrastructure, and freight corridors within the urban area are
planned, and in by-laws. However, some municipalities have given a higher importance to freight, and
have developed specific goods movement strategy documents recognizing the critical importance of
goods movement for both the economy and quality of life (examples include Calgary, Edmonton and
Peel Region). These documents can be used by planners in other municipalities as starting points for
developing their own goods movement strategy and supportive policies in order to meet planning
objectives like maximize efficiency and safety.

1.1.2

Primary regional corridors / trade routes and key characteristics

Trade routes within Canada are primarily on land (road and rail), and connect major hubs within the
country to each other, as well as to coastal ports and land border crossings. These corridors are crucial
to the nation in supporting the movement of goods and its planning, whether local, regional, provincial,
or international. Figure 1.1.1 below shows Canada’s three primary trade corridors, which connect to
international trade routes.

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

As a geographically large nation that relies to a large extent on global trade (trade as a percentage of
GDP peaked at 82.9% in 2000, and was 64.1% as of 2017) 10 with access to oceans on both coasts,
internal trade routes that allow goods from all over the country to be transported efficiently are critical
in ensuring the economic vitality of the nation. The federal government has acknowledged the
importance of such trade routes, as made evident by the Trade and Transportation Corridors Initiative
and the National Trade Corridors Fund, which helps fund projects that seek to make Canada’s trade
corridors more efficient and reliable. 11
While the overall transportation system in Canada is connected across jurisdictions, there exist instances
where there is a lack of coordination between government jurisdictions, which may cause problems for
the movement of goods due to varying weight, time or size restrictions for example. The particular roles
and responsibilities of different levels of government are further described in Section 1.3.

Western (Asia-Pacific) corridor
The Western Corridor serves Canadian bulk commodity exports such as crude oil, grain, coal, wood
products, potash and copper, and operates primarily by rail or marine modes of transportation. These
goods are destined primarily for North American and Asian markets. In 2016, goods exports valued at
$101 billion flowed through this corridor. In addition, this corridor links container imports from Asia to
Central Canada and the Midwestern U.S.
There are several ports along this corridor, with the two main marine ports located in BC – Port of
Vancouver and Port of Prince Rupert. Figure 1.1.2 shows marine ports and inland terminals (also known
as dry ports) in Western Canada along the Western Corridor. Canadian marine ports face competition
from the U.S. ports of Seattle-Tacoma, Los Angeles, and Long Beach. Market share for the ports of
Vancouver and Prince Rupert versus Seattle-Tacoma are 12%, 48.5% and 39.5% respectively. 12 The
inland terminals serve as key regional and national hubs, particularly CentrePort, which is the topic of
the second case study in Section 4.2, along with the Global Transportation Hub, Calgary Regional Inland
Terminal, and Port Alberta – all of which are foreign trade zones (FTZs).

Also included in the Western Corridor is a network of Class I and shortline railways that provide freight
transportation. Figure 1.1.3 shows rail infrastructure in Western Canada. The primary Canadian
operators of Class I freight lines are the Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Railway
(CP), and these Canadian companies are in competition with American companies such as the BNSF
Railway Company (BNSF). Shortline rail infrastructure in Western Canada include 26 railways, each
operated by its respective municipality, a private business, or a cooperative who purchased abandoned
CN and CP lines. 13 These shortline railways transport goods such as agricultural products, fuels, and
chemicals to businesses that are built directly along the railway.
Figure 1.1.3: Western Canadian rail infrastructure
(Source: Transport Canada, 2018)

Continental (Ontario-Quebec) corridor
The Continental Corridor is the busiest of Canada’s three major freight corridors in terms of surface
traffic, with road, rail and marine being its primary modes. Air, however, is also a significant mode within
this corridor with Toronto Pearson International, Montreal-Mirabel International, and Montreal-Pierre
Elliott Trudeau International Airports accounting for 54% of Canadian air traffic cargo in 2016. Goods
shipped by air are typically high-value and time-sensitive merchandise such as pharmaceuticals and
precious metals. For road infrastructure, the Continental Corridor includes Ontario’s Highway 401, which
is recognized as the busiest highway in North America. Highway 401 serves as the primary route for
east-west travel within Ontario, and merges into Autoroute 20 at the Ontario-Quebec border, which is
part of the Trans-Canada Highway. For intermodal terminals, the four largest facilities are located within
the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and Montreal, and serve as key hubs for the efficient movement of
goods.
The Continental Corridor serves Central Canada, connects to the U.S. Midwest and Northeast, and
moves goods internationally through the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway. The St. Lawrence River,

corridor include automotive products and parts, wood products, metals/minerals, coal, petroleum
products and salt. The vast majority of Canadian exports travelling through this corridor end up in the
U.S. (about 80%), with Europe, Asia and Mexico being the other markets. The corridor also acts as a
transportation hub for the Western and Atlantic Corridors, as many of the goods entering or exiting the
ports of Halifax and Vancouver are going to or coming from Ontario or Quebec. 14
The major marine ports within this corridor include the Port of Montreal, Port of Thunder Bay, and Port
of Sept-Iles. These ports compete with the Port of New York, as well as other Canadian river and marine
ports for business in order to be the port of call in a specific corridor for the commodities that the
specific port is capable of handling, since ports will vary based on the type of port (gateway, local, or
transshipment), and commodities (container or liquid bulk). 15

Atlantic corridor
The Atlantic Corridor is primarily a marine corridor for international market access; however, it also has
key strategic airports, border crossings, and road and rail connections for access to major North
American markets. 16 International markets served include the U.S., Mexico, Europe, the Caribbean, Latin
America and Asia. As container trade continues to increase as a percentage of overall maritime trade,
the Atlantic Corridor is well positioned to help Canada capture a larger share of trade flows between
North America and international markets. This opportunity is a result of the region’s transportation
assets, which include transloading and logistics facilities and specialized distribution for example, to
handle common and niche cargo.
The key marine port in this corridor is the Port of Halifax, the closest North American point of ice-free
and minimal tide access to Europe and Asia. The Port of Saint John is another important port, which is
the second largest port in the Atlantic Corridor. Figure 1.1.4 is a representation of the corridor and its
marine and air ports, as well as rail and highway infrastructure.

Through this corridor, the key commodities exported include containerized petroleum products and
seafood products. Key imports through this corridor include crude petroleum and automobiles. In 2016,
$24 billion worth of goods travelled through (excluding pipeline exports) the Atlantic Corridor. Of these
exports, 70% ended up in the U.S. and Mexico, while Europe and Asia both received 13%.

1.1.3

Economic drivers of trade

What economic factors drive trade? This is a key question to answer in order to understand what is
responsible, at least in part, for the movement of goods within and between countries. In the case of
Canada, one of the primary drivers of trade is the economic performance of Canada’s top trading
partners: the U.S., China, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and the European Union (EU). For example, after
the 2008 global financial crisis, Canada’s overall exports to its top trading partners dropped significantly.
Another related factor is the value of a country’s currency. For example, when Canada’s currency drops
relative to the Euro, it is more likely that European countries will buy more Canadian goods as they
become less expensive. Another factor is commodity prices. If Canada’s export commodity prices are
cheaper than other countries, it is more likely that foreign countries will buy Canadian goods.
Free trade agreements are another factor that drives trade. As of March 2019, Canada was party to 14
free trade agreements 17 with other countries that are currently in force, which increases the likelihood
of trading with these nations as the agreements substantially lower or even remove tariffs, increasing
the attractiveness of global trade with Canada. Finally, the demand for goods must also be taken into
consideration, since if there is limited demand, there will be limited trade.

Transportation infrastructure / network ownership

Who owns and operates air and marine port, road, and railway infrastructure? Generally, roads are
owned by governments, railways are private, airports are run as not-for-profit, and marine ports have
mixed ownership/operation.
Table 1.1.2 provides an overview of the level of ownership for goods movement infrastructure, while
Section 1.2 provides more in-depth information for each mode. Section 1.3.4 defines the responsibilities
of different levels of government, which includes ownership and operation.

Modal profiles 18

1.2.1

Road

In Canada, road infrastructure is typically operated by provincial, territorial or municipal governments.
Overall, Canada boasts over 1.13 million kilometres of two-lane equivalent lane-kilometres of public
roads, approximately 40% of which are paved. Canada’s National Highway System (NHS), formed in 1988
by the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Council of Ministers Responsible for Transportation and Highway
Safety, is mainly a classification system for strategically significant routes, and is responsible for primary
routes that support inter-provincial/territorial and international trade and travel by connecting a capital
city or major provincial population or commercial centre in Canada with:
•

Other major provincial population or commercial centres in the same or in an adjacent province

•

Major ports of entry or exit with the United States

•

Other transportation modes directly served by highways, such as ferry terminals 19

The NHS encompasses over 38,000 lane-kilometres of highways as of 2015, managed by the provinces.
The roads are divided into three categories, defined in Table 1.2.1 below, and displayed in Figure 1.2.1.
The safety of these roads is jointly managed by the federal, provincial, and territorial levels of
government. The federal level is responsible for safety standards for new and imported vehicles, tires,
and restraining equipment for children and persons with disabilities. The provinces and territories are
responsible for driver licensing, vehicle registration, and safe operations including size and weight
restrictions, distracted driving, and speed limits. 20

During the winter months, ice roads in northern provincial regions and territories connect remote
communities to a permanent highway or railway system, from roughly mid-January until thaw in spring.
These roads provide multiple benefits for remote and isolated communities which are often accessible
only by air for a majority of the year. Some of the benefits of ice roads include: reduced costs of
transporting consumer goods, fuels, and construction supplies versus air freight; more affordable and
convenient access to primary health care and other services outside of the communities; and improved
year-round access to these areas, helping the local economy in these communities through access to
mineral resources for example. 21 Overall, Canada boasts over 5,300 kilometres of ice roads during the
winter, with the longest single ice road at nearly 600 kilometres connecting Tibbitt in the Northwest
Territories to Contwoyto in Nunavut. 22

In 2016, the value of trucking traffic between Canada and the U.S. reached $418 billion, with the main
commodities being automotive products, machinery and electrical equipment, other manufactured
products, and agricultural products. Overall, road is the most popular mode of transport for freight
traffic, and the most common commodity is manufactured goods.
Using data gathered from the Canadian Freight Analysis Framework (CFAF), Table 1.2.2 below presents
the average distance goods travelled from all origins within Canada, to all destinations within Canada,
and to the U.S. and Mexico. The framework only captures data for rail, air and for-hire truck. Data for
marine and private truck was not available. This data helps to demonstrate the use of different modes.
For instance, for-hire truck has the most total shipments, though its average value is much lower than
air, while average distances are roughly equivalent, indicating that lower value goods are less timesensitive and therefore can employ a less expensive mode for shipment.

As of December 2016, there were 66,751 Canadian businesses whose primary activity was trucking
transportation. There are three main types of trucking activities: for-hire, courier and private carrier.
For-hire trucking services carry goods from other companies and operate truckload or less than
truckload trips; courier services specialize in transporting parcels; and private carriers are fleets owned
and operated by businesses who ship their own goods. Companies select one of these three options
depending on the size and weight of goods, and frequency and value of shipments.
As the most-used mode of transport by total shipments, for-hire truck transportation is a crucial goods
movement channel that can have significant impacts on the Canadian economy, as well as the safety of
the road transportation network. Urban congestion has a significant impact on the trucking industry, as
drivers must meet shipment times while respecting their federally-mandated hours of service (HOS)
limits on driving and requirements for off-duty time. Rigid HOS requirements often force drivers to take
long breaks which at times do not align with driver levels of alertness. Further, for these breaks to fit
into a driver’s schedule, they must often drive during morning and evening peak periods. Flexibility for
HOS would allow for drivers to spend less time on the road, while achieving the same travel distance. 26
It would also help to take trucks off roads during peak commuter times, increasing time savings for all
road users. Municipalities can contribute to solving this issue by allowing for solutions such as off-peak
delivery, and adjusting truck route time of day restrictions.
While it is important to understand road networks, issues in the for-hire trucking industry, and how
companies ship their goods, environmental considerations are equally important. The 2016 PanCanadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change includes a commitment from federal,
provincial and territorial governments to develop a Canada-wide strategy for zero-emissions vehicles by
2018. Further, the federal government continues to work to implement emissions standards for heavyduty vehicles and engines for vehicle model years 2014 and newer, in an attempt to establish strict
standards to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to set new standards for trailers through the
Heavy-Duty Vehicle and Engine GHG Emission Regulations.
These standards come as a result of the state of emissions from the transportation sector, most
specifically road transportation. Between 2005 and 2014, overall emissions from road use increased by
3% despite fuel efficiency improvements across all vehicle classes. The increase was due to a growth in
both passenger and freight activity, and a shift to more GHG-intensive transportation such as heavy-duty
trucks and larger passenger vehicles. During the same period, freight emissions increased 14%, from 48
to 55 megatonnes, while road freight activity increased 25% (when measured in tonne-kilometres). In
total, in 2016 road transportation (including electricity) accounted for 38% of all Canadian GHG
emissions. 27

Trans-Canada Highway 28 29
The Trans-Canada Highway is the longest national road in the country, spanning from Victoria, British
Columbia to St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador. The highway’s construction began in 1950 under
the Trans-Canada Highway Act, and was completed in 1971, although it officially opened in 1962. It
passes through all ten provinces, thought it does not pass through the territories. It provides linkages to
the major cities in Canada, and currently includes several different routes that help to better connect
cities than the original single route, which totals nearly 8,000 kilometres in length.
The project was funded on a cost-sharing basis between provinces and the federal government, and as
such had to meet specific design standards set forth by the federal government. Many of the sections
along the route had existed prior to the development of this highway, though they required upgrades to
meet federal standards. While the funding of the project was shared between these levels of
government, the provinces remain primarily responsible for the design, construction, safety standards,
and financing of sections of the road under their jurisdiction. The only exception to this authority are the
sections of the Trans-Canada Highway that are in national parks, which fall under federal jurisdiction.
The Trans-Canada Highway contributes to the economic development of Canada, strengthening ground
transportation for goods to travel across the country, at a relatively inexpensive cost. Communities
along this route have benefitted from increased regional and national connectivity. Further, these goods
can travel closer to, and even directly through many major cities, without the need to load and unload
at intermodal yards. As a result of this increased ease of national goods movement, the demand for
goods like metal structures, concrete, bitumen, construction materials, gravel, and sand all rose. In
addition, the highway also helped initiate a boom in the bridge and road construction industry,
increasing access to local and international markets.

1.2.2

Air

Air freight transportation in Canada is managed by NAV CANADA, one of the largest air navigation
service providers in the world by total instrument flight rules (IFR) flight hours, which manages the
world’s third-largest aerospace sector, at over 18,000,000 kilometres. Within the Canadian airport
system there are 26 National Airport System (NAS) airports which manage both passenger and freight,
31 small and satellite airports without scheduled passenger services, 13 remote airports providing the
only reliable year-round transportation link to isolated communities, and 11 arctic airports, including the
three territorial capital airports counted in the NAS. Figure 1.2.2 below shows NAS infrastructure in
Canada.
Airport authorities (operators of NAS airports) in Canada, as non-share and not-for-profit entities, have
organizational structures that place the responsibility locally, rather than on the federal government. For
example, the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) which operates Toronto Pearson International
Airport, has a board of directors including community members such as local boards of trade, the Law
Society of Upper Canada, and Professional Engineers Ontario and municipal representatives. This helps
to ensure that the airport operates in line with the objectives of local public and private stakeholders.
Air freight is used primarily for high-value commodities such as machinery, medical and electronic
equipment, aircraft materials, precious metals and stones, and pharmaceutical products. Air freight is
also used to supply general cargo to remote communities. In 2016, air freight loading and unloading at
Canadian airports equaled roughly 1.2 million tonnes, with a value of approximately $125 billion.

12

February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

In 2016, air freight transportation accounted for less than 1% of transportation-related emissions,
expelling 0.41 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent GHGs. Canada is a member of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations. In 2016, the ICAO agreed to a
new CO2 standard for airplanes, which is projected to cut global emissions by 650 megatonnes over
2020-2040.
Figure 1.2.2: Air transportation network
(Source: Transport Canada, 2018)

1.2.3

Rail

There is approximately 41,700 route-kilometres of rail track which is owned primarily by CN (52%) and
CP (31%) rail companies. There are also 19 intermodal terminals, which are operated by CN and CP, and
27 border crossings with the U.S. In maintaining this infrastructure, railway companies must reinvest
roughly 20% of their profits into maintenance activities. Between 2011 and 2016, this 20% averaged
roughly $1.8 billion annually. In 2016, total freight tonnage on rail was 297.4 million tonnes, with an
international trade traffic value of $128.3 billion.
There are over 60 rail companies that operate on Canada’s rail network. Railways are classified as either
Class I or Class II (also known as shortline). Classification criteria and examples of the companies are
provided in Table 1.2.3. It should be noted that for Class I railways, CN and CP are the only Canadian
companies that operate. The remaining Class I railways are American but operate some lines in Canada
on track owned by CN or CP.

Rail freight transportation specializes in bulk commodities and containerized traffic over long distances.
The main imports that travel by rail are automotive products and chemical products, while the primary
exports are the same as imports in addition to forest products and metals.

In 2016, GHG emissions from freight rail totaled 6.3 megatonnes, representing 0.04% of total
transportation-related emissions. The freight industry accounts for 98% of all rail GHG emissions, and
emissions increased 14% between 2005 and 2014 due to a large increase in freight activity. In a move to
standardize emissions within the greater North American rail system, Transport Canada and the Railway
Association of Canada entered into a memorandum of understanding – originally between 2011-2015
and extended to the end of 2017 – to encourage voluntary emissions reductions by railway companies.
Further, in 2017 the Locomotive Emissions Regulations entered into force, with the goal of limiting
harmful emissions from locomotives operated by railway companies through mandatory emission
standards and reduced idling.

1.2.4

Marine

Marine infrastructure in Canada includes 559 total port facilities as of 2017. Transport Canada owns and
operates 47 port facilities, and oversees port activities for remote, local/regional, and public ports
throughout the country. Independent Canada Port Authorities (CPA) own and operate 18 major port
facilities that are financially self-sufficient with their activities overseen by Transport Canada. Of these
18 ports, the most significant include Port of Vancouver, Port of Montreal, Port of Prince Rupert, and
Port of Halifax.
Access points include the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, the Arctic/Northern region, the Great Lakes and the
St. Lawrence River. In 2016, the total value of trade that passed through Canadian ports was $199
billion, $7 billion of which flowed through the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway. Contained within
this Central Canadian marine system are 15 major international ports and 50 regional ports that connect
to over 40 provincial or interstate (U.S.) highways and 30 rail lines. Primary goods carried through this
system are grain, coal, iron ore, petroleum products, salt, gravel and stone. There is a close history of
regulatory cooperation with the U.S. to facilitate cross-border flows of goods. Figure 1.2.3 shows an
overview of rail and port infrastructure in Canada.
The Pacific coast marine activity caters to international and domestic trade, with trade to the U.S.
occurring primarily between the States of Alaska, Oregon and Washington. Freight movement in this

14

region includes general cargo for community resupply, wood products, gravel, stones, construction
materials and coal.
Figure 1.2.3: Rail and port infrastructure
(Source: Transport Canada, 2018)

The Atlantic coast has most of its trans-border trade with the U.S. operated by international marine
carriers; however, there remains a strong presence of Canadian businesses and producers, especially
those in the mining and petroleum sectors. The primary goods transported through this system include
general cargo for community resupplies, petroleum products, iron ore and nickel.
In the Northern region, goods are moved to provide basic necessities from Southern Canada to remote
communities in the three Territories, occurring seasonally as access is limited during the winter months.
Similarly, resource projects in the Northern region rely on marine transportation to transport equipment
and supplies from the south as well as shipping their products to southern markets. The four main
marine systems that resupply northern communities are: Athabasca marine resupply system; Mackenzie
River and western Arctic system; Inside Passage and Yukon system; and Keewatin/Hudson Bay and
Eastern Arctic system.
In 2017, Canada’s commercial registered fleet (vessels that transport 1,000 gross tonnes and more)
comprised 189 vessels and a total of 2.3 million gross tonnes. This fleet includes dry bulk vessels,
tankers, general cargo vessels, and ferries, but excludes tugs used for offshore resupply. Further, fleets
February 2021

15

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

of 510 tugs and 2,031 barges (both defined at 15 gross tonnes and more) operated primarily on
Canada’s Pacific coast. In addition, Canadians owned 362 ocean-going ships that trade internationally
under foreign flags.
In terms of the marine mode’s effect on public safety and the environment, the federal government
introduced a $1.5 billion investment through the Oceans Protection Plan in 2016 which added
regulations for safety and seeks to restore and preserve marine ecosystems, create opportunities for
Indigenous communities to participate in shipping and the marine safety regime, and strengthen
environmental protection. The goal is to combat GHG emissions (which decreased 2.6% between 20052014 as a result of shippers shifting to other modes) and oil spills. The National Aerial Surveillance
Program flew 2,068 hours observing Canada’s three coasts in 2016-2017, and found 246 oil spills totaling
2,870 litres of oil in the water. Some measures that have been implemented to strengthen
environmental protection include $11 billion of funding to install shore power 30 at the Port of
Vancouver and Port of Montreal in 2015, protection from invasive species through ballast water
inspections, and other GHG and air pollutant emissions restrictions.

1.2.5

Modal choice rationale

Different modes are best suited for different types of shipments based on a number of different factors.
Some general considerations for modal choice include:
•

Type and size of cargo

•

Cost of shipping and transfers

•

Time factors

•

Geographic location and availability/complementarity of modes

•

Destination of cargo

•

Distance

•

Availability of services

•

Past experiences/in-house expertise and resources

•

Ease to organize

•

Legal and insurance issues

After having selected the preferred mode for shipping the selected goods, a route must then be chosen.
In selecting a route, carriers (defined in the next section) must consider cost-effectiveness, time
sensitivity of shipment, optimized sequence of deliveries, and potential restrictions. In managing these
constraints, carrier companies can use algorithms which deliver optimal routes based on their origins
and destinations. 31
Table 1.2.4 below provides an example of modal choice rationale, demonstrating which modes are best
suited for certain types of shipments, while Figure 1.2.4 shows modal choice based on considerations for
cost, volume of goods shipped, and value of time.
As presented in the figure and table on the next page, cost, value, and distance are interdependent. For
example, time sensitive goods and low-volume goods such as medical equipment or precious gems will
most likely be shipped by air, since their cost per unit is higher. These costs will then be absorbed within
the sale value of the cargo. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the value of un-refined crude oil or iron

16

ore will be lower per unit-weight and less time-sensitive but higher in volume, hence the use of the
slower but higher-capacity transport modes.

Determining total logistics cost
There are a number of factors that go into the total logistics cost of a supply chain. Below is a list of the
primary determinants of total costs:
•

Length of haul

•

Weight of goods

•

Packaging and product handling

•

Number and size of shipments

•

Customer preference

•

Shipment value

Trade-offs in use

Selecting the most appropriate and cost-effective method of transporting goods is something that
companies must do to ensure the efficient movement of their products. In this section, we present
trade-offs between road and rail modes, and between courier, long haul and delivery methods of
shipping. Table 1.2.5 shows trade-offs between road and rail.

Definition of actors

This section presents a range of actors in the freight transportation system including shippers, carriers
and third-party logistics providers, and the roles and responsibilities of varying levels of government
with respect to the different modes available.

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

1.3.1

Shipper / service user

A shipper is the person or company who is usually the supplier or owner of the goods that will be
shipped. 32 They enter into contracts with carriers and provide them with goods to transport or arrange
for and coordinate the shipment of goods to reach their chosen market.

1.3.2

Carrier / service provider

Carriers are companies that transport goods for shippers and service users by a selected mode. 33 They
can be a shipping line, railway company, freight airline or a trucking company. These companies have
possession of the goods while they are in transit. 34 In the case of road transport, carriers are further
divided into private, courier and for-hire. Private carriers provide transportation services to firms that
own or lease transport vehicles and do not charge a fee. For-hire carriers provide transportation services
to the public on a fee basis. They select routes largely based on minimizing costs through optimization of
routes. Costs for carriers sometimes increase when there are few truck stops along the route with direct
and un-tolled highway access. Designated truck parking areas can help to keep costs low along the
supply chain as drivers do not have to waste time search for adequate parking. They also ensure that
drivers have safe locations to rest, adding to the overall safety of the road network.

1.3.3

Third-party logistics provider (3PL)

A third-party logistics provider (3PL) is a specialist in logistics who may provide a variety of
transportation, warehousing, and logistics related services to buyers or sellers. These are tasks that are
often performed in-house, but can be outsourced in certain cases. 35 3PL companies handle the
fulfillment and distribution functions of many retailers, and capitalize on economics of scale, particularly
when direct retail fulfillment is not cost-effective.

1.3.4

Municipal, regional, provincial / territorial and federal governments

1.3.4.1

Municipal

Municipal governments typically do not own goods movement infrastructure, and instead coordinate
with other levels of government to share information and data, establish a goods movement network
and strategic plan, establish freight objectives and policies, set by-laws, and standardize approaches and
norms in order to address issues faced by the city and freight operators. 36, 37 Municipalities are also
involved in regulating land use, overseeing development and site design, and managing road design and
operations. This includes setting route and time of day restrictions for freight, developing curbside
loading/unloading zones, and enforcing parking restrictions.
Finally, municipalities are also involved in some rail expenditures, though railways are owned by private
companies. Expenditures are typically related to commuter rail operations or public safety
investments. 38 Overall, the role of the municipal government is focused on planning, oversight and
safety. This is ultimately done through planning and policy documents that help to guide the
development of an area and efficient use of resources. Examples include transportation or freight
master plans, official plans, zoning by-laws, and other land use documents.
In northern communities in Ontario for example, there are some areas that are uncategorized, where
there is no municipal organization. In these communities, local service and road boards are created to

February 2021

19

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

deliver basic community services to the residents. The province maintains its maintenance duty on these
roads as well. Additionally, some non-remote and non-NAS airports are locally or provincially owned and
operated, either by local airport authorities, the province, or municipalities themselves. These airports
tend to be smaller, primarily serving the immediate community with commercial and passenger
transportation, as well as private jet storage, medical emergency evacuation support, recreational flying,
and even skydiving. 39

1.3.4.2

Regional

Regional government roles include creating guidelines for freight, establishing goods movement regional
strategic plans, planning through crown agencies and regional municipalities, and coordinating with
other regions and municipalities. 40 In addition, pilotage (a service where marine pilots take control of a
vessel and navigate it through local waterways) 41 through Canada’s coastal and inland waterways is
provided on a for-fee basis by four regional pilotage authorities which are crown corporations: Atlantic,
Laurentian, Great Lakes, and Pacific Pilotage Authorities.

1.3.4.3

Provincial/territorial

Provincial (and territorial) government departments own and manage the majority of two-lane
equivalent roads within their respective borders and develop highway traffic acts to regulate vehicle and
driver use on these roads, including licensing and road and vehicle safety regulations (such as vehicle
dimension and weight regulations, and truck driver hours of service). This includes the majority of
provincial routes within the National Highway System (e.g. 400-series highways in Ontario, Provincial
Trunk Highways in Manitoba, and the Autoroute network in Quebec), the Trans-Canada Highway, as well
as the majority of other roads. They are also involved in:
•

Guiding transportation infrastructure investments, policy, and strategy 42

•

Creating and managing crown agencies (e.g. regional transportation authorities) to plan, build,
and manage infrastructure 43

•

Managing the freight sector through ministries of transportation, infrastructure, environment,
and economic development 44

•

Developing strategies to manage and enhance transportation infrastructure, reduce emissions,
and increase goods movement network capacity

•

Coordinating policy with municipal and federal agencies

•

Applying environmental standards to provincial transportation infrastructure

Territories in Canada are also involved in airports as each territorial government owns and operates (or
contracts operations for) their own NAS airport. The airports these governments are responsible for are
Yellowknife Airport, Iqaluit Airport, and Erik Nielson Whitehorse International Airport. 45 In Northern
Ontario, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation’s (MTO) Remote Northern Transportation Office
operates the 29 remote northern airports in the province. All but two of these airports (Pickle Lake and
Armstrong) serve Aboriginal communities which lack all-weather road access and rely on air
transportation for the delivery of goods and passenger transportation. The safe operation of these
airports is crucial to the livability and economic vitality of these communities. 46

1.3.4.4

Federal

The roles and responsibilities of Canada’s federal government are divided by mode for the purposes of
this section, as their involvement varies and responsibilities are often shared or divided between the
federal government and lower levels.

Road
The Alaska Highway and some parts of the NHS within national parks are owned and managed by
federal departments. The federal government participates in highway infrastructure development,
which is generally funded through Infrastructure Canada and/or Transport Canada. Transport Canada, in
addition to funding certain projects, also promotes highway safety throughout the country, develops
policy for the NHS, and acts as the regulatory body for interprovincial and international freight and
passenger carrier industries.

Rail
The federal government’s primary role with relation to rail is the regulation of service, rates, network
rationalization, and overall safety of railways within its jurisdiction, under the Canada Transportation
and Rail and Safety Acts.

Air
The primary role of the federal government for air travel is infrastructure related. The majority of large
Canadian airports have been transferred to local authorities, however the federal government maintains
ownership of the land and buildings, and also acts as a regulator. Smaller airports (non-NAS) have
generally been sold to provinces or municipalities.
As part of the regulatory framework, Transport Canada develops policies, guidelines, regulations,
standards, and educational materials to advance civil aviation safety in Canada. It also verifies that the
aviation industry complies with the regulatory framework through certifications, assessments,
validations, inspections, and enforcement.

Marine
Transport Canada administers certain remote ports; however, as described above in the modal profiles
section, major ports are operated by Canada Port Authorities – crown corporations operating at arm’s
length from Transport Canada, governed by a board of directors selected by port users, and the
municipal, provincial, and federal government. Transport Canada is also encouraging the divestiture of
core fishing harbours to non-profit harbour authorities to manage and maintain operations. It is also
involved in policy development, services to commercial and recreational mariners, and maritime safety
and security.

1.4

Industry and commodity profiles

1.4.1

Understanding industry vs. commodity

Goods movement, as defined in Section 1.1.1, is broadly the wide array of activities involved in
transporting goods from producer/supplier to consumer. It is a derived demand driven by consumption

February 2021

21

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

and commerce. In other words, the demand for transport is a result of the demand for other goods or
services.
Goods movement industries are categorizations of inputs of production for the output of an
intermediate or final product, to be used in other industries. Industries produce the commodities that
other industries use by adding value to raw materials or assembling multiple intermediate goods.
Industries are classified by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), six-digit codes at
their most detailed level, and divided into twenty larger sectors by the first two digits.
While commodities and industries are heavily intertwined and rely upon each other, they are distinct
terms with specific requirements of their own. Commodities can be raw materials or primary agricultural
products (e.g. timber, copper, halibut) or intermediate or finished goods (e.g. electronics, motorized
vehicle parts, pharmaceuticals). Depending on the commodity, it will enter the supply chain at a
different stage as either an input to production for another goods movement industry or as the final
output of production of a goods movement industry. All commodities can be shipped, and interact in
some way with the transportation network. Most often, commodities are used as inputs in the
production of finished goods and are classified by Standard Classification of Transported Goods (SCTG)
five-digit codes. The first two digits of the codes group the commodities into forty-two Harmonized
Commodity Description and Coding System-based categories.

1.4.2

Industry profiles

Six goods movement industries are identified below based on NAICS two-digit codes, as follows:
agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting (11); mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction (21);
construction (23); manufacturing (31-33); wholesale trade (41); and retail trade (44-45). Table 1.4.1
presents industry profiles with associated two-digit NAICS codes, typical modes used, and their
characteristics.

Municipalities and provinces/territories use NAICS codes to organize industry information when
conducting employment surveys. The above goods movement industry profiles are therefore useful
information in understanding how these industries interact with each other and the transportation
network. Further, it is of particular use to planners, as this information can help with the understanding
and development of future employment surveys.

1.4.3

Commodity / economic sector profiles

SCTG codes classify commodities by their transportation characteristics, and commodities can be further
classified by their value and time sensitivity. For example, precision instruments and apparatus (38) are
considered high-value and time sensitive commodities, whereas cereal grains (02) are considered lowvalue and less or non-time sensitive.
Commodities can be linked to industries at two levels. First is by the propensity of an industry to ship
certain commodities. This first measure would indicate what percent of shipments from each industry
are a particular commodity. Second is by the proportion of industries shipping certain commodities. This
measure indicates which industries are responsible for the majority of shipments of a given commodity.
Table 1.4.2 provides commodity profiles. Due to the large number of two-digit SCTG codes, nine twodigit categories have been grouped to present examples.

1.5

Understanding supply chains

In this section, we present the components and considerations for forming supply chains, how they
relate to local and intercity freight issues, and then present a case study to demonstrate the flow of
goods through a supply chain.

1.5.1

Supply chain creation

To begin, there are a few important general factors that must be considered when forming a supply
chain. The first factor is speed to market. Products that spoil easily or have higher value require faster
speeds to market compared to low-value, non-perishable goods for instance. For fresh foods, there is
typically a window of only a few days from farm to market to ensure they are still safe for consumption.
For high value products like pharmaceuticals, they must be delivered before their potency date expires.
There are also products like ready-mix concrete that must be poured within hours of leaving the plant.
The second factor is cost-effectiveness. Companies try to ensure that the supply chain for a product is
setup in the most cost-effective manner to limit costs to the company, and costs pushed along the chain
to customers. Typically, the efficiency of the overall supply chain plays an important role in ensuring the
costs remain low.
The third factor is reliability. Firms want to ensure their products are being delivered on time and in
good condition. Modal selection and route rely heavily on reliability, as a firm would not reasonably
select transporting perishable foodstuffs, such as eggs or fruits, by sea unless this is the only mode of
access to the market. This is because marine travel takes the longest amount of time and refrigeration
costs increase with transportation time.
The basic route of a supply chain is shown below:

Place of origin

Place of production,
processing, warehousing
or distribution

Place of consumption

Along this chain, each arrow represents transportation of the goods by the mode selected by the
organizer or the chain. Figure 1.5.1 to Figure 1.5.4 below are some examples of supply chains, which
demonstrate where the materials/goods are produced, where they travel to, and by what mode, along
with their SCTG codes. 47 They include the commodity movement and include value added services in the
supply chain which result in the commodities being manufactured into finished products. Figure 1.5.1 is
the related legend that describes flows and modes.

1.5.2

Principal channels for urban goods movement

In urban settings, the movement of goods primarily takes place though one of three channels:
•

Industrial production – This involves the manufacturing of heavy and light goods bound for
businesses and retail outlets. These shipments are typically products for input for another
business or finished products for retail distribution.

•

Retail distribution – This channel is for businesses that distribute consumer products like food,
electronics, publications, and housewares through wholesale and store-front facilities. These
products can be purchased by consumers at storefronts, or ordered online via e-commerce and
delivered directly to their homes.

•

Service provision – This channel targets service-oriented businesses supplied with, or handling,
goods for their engagements such as constructing facilities, caring for health, mounting
exhibitions, moving household goods, and removing waste.

1.5.3

Factors and trends affecting supply chain processes

There are several local and intercity freight issues that must be considered when forming a supply chain.
These issues affect the modes chosen and order, costs of the overall chain, and the time it takes to
deliver goods. For example, just-in-time deliveries have become increasingly prevalent in the past few
decades as businesses attempt to minimize spending and boost competitiveness. 48 Just-in-time is an
alternative to a just-in-case model where businesses have large lots and inventories in anticipation of
demand. Figure 1.5.5 presents a brief look at differences between these two models.
Just-in-time involves the suppression of stock in warehouses, low inventories in stores, a fragmentation
of shipments, fast turnaround times in production areas and distribution centres, and coordination
between industries, modes, and carriers. It is a truck and resource extensive model that requires
integration between many productive units; however, this model results in a made-to-order system with
minimal stock levels and lower warehousing costs than just-in-case.

28

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

Figure 1.5.5: Just-in-case vs. Just-in-time delivery
(Source: Macrovector, 2019; Market Business News, 2019)

Just-in-time helps to combat other issues that are faced along supply chains, particularly those related
to large delivery trucks, including: lack of curbside delivery space; parking and route restrictions, and
narrow streets or turning radii; zoning and land use restrictions faced by distribution centres, primarily
in urban areas; and last-mile delivery in urban areas, especially in central business districts or for home
delivery. Just-in-time may not, however, be applicable for all types of goods (e.g. food production).
There are also trade-offs between shipping goods by courier, long haul, or delivery methods. Table 1.5.1
below presents characteristics for each shipping type.

Module 2: Planning considerations

The purpose of this module is to introduce the audience to a range of considerations made by both
governments and freight companies. Considerations should be made for how projects are selected and
evaluated, what data is available to use in planning, and freight sensitive strategies that are available for
planners with regards to goods movement infrastructure. Its major sections are:
•

Project Planning

•

Data Collection and Management

•

Stakeholder Consultation

•

Analysis of Current and Future Needs

•

Developing Strategies

•

Evaluation Tools

•

Integration with Other Disciplines

•

Road Design

•

Site Design

•

Demand Modelling

At the end of this module, the audience should have an understanding of what considerations should be
made for freight when planning projects, as well as how to effectively evaluate a potential project to
ensure it will provide the desired outcomes.

2.1

Project planning 49

Project planning is an economic development tool used to assist municipalities, planners, and engineers
in making informed decisions to enable the safe and efficient movement of freight and its integration in
the built environment. The objectives of the process include identifying locations where freight activities
are generated or attracted (either currently or in the future), operating constraints, and stakeholder
dialogue. Planning of this variety is useful because it helps to identify issues affecting local freight
movements, and establishing priorities to support the movement of goods.

Potential problems
The planning phase of a project begins with project setup, which involves defining problems faced that
the project is seeking to solve, establishing the goals and objectives of the project, defining a project
timeline, and identifying staff and financial resources. Some potential problems to tackle include:
•

Congestion

•

Pollution

•

Water, noise, and air quality

•

Interaction between trucks/trains/ ports and neighbouring residents

•

Interaction between trucks and pedestrians/bicycles/cars

February 2021

31

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices
•

Safety

•

Accessibility 50

•

Truck transit during roadwork

•

Competition for land use

•

Lack of transport infrastructure

•

Lack of transport services

Potential goals and objectives
In a traditional planning process, goals and objectives of the project are then defined. They respond to
the problems identified that the project will hopefully solve, and are therefore project- and contextspecific. Some potential goals and objectives are:
•

Remove truck traffic on local streets

•

Improve existing/build new road infrastructure

•

Increase capacity of networks/terminals

•

Decrease negative impacts of transport interaction with the population

•

Increase accessibility

•

Reduce congestion

•

Improve safety

•

Increase service performance

•

Reduce costs

•

Generate value and revenues

•

Requalification of land 51

•

Modal shift

Required information
After the problems and goals/objectives of a project have been clearly identified, the information
required for the project must be collected for future analysis. This information is based on defined
problems, staff, and resources available. Some examples include:

32

•

Major goods movement facilities and corridors (employment areas and uses)

•

Principal freight corridors and secondary feeder routes, including traffic volumes and patterns

•

Contribution by the freight industry to the local economy

•

Traffic activity by mode

•

Route constraints (e.g. geometric considerations at intersections, signal timings, speed limits,
vehicle exclusions, lane widths)

•

Operating constraints (e.g. loading acres, time of day restrictions, street furniture)

•

Other relevant factors of interest to the public

•

Applicable regulations (e.g. overweight or size limits)

•

Enforcement practices, including ticket violations and compliance rates

•

Areas of conflict
February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices
•

Road construction and maintenance

The amount of information required to be collected will be a function of the size of a community,
whether a freight issue exists that requires resolution, and the amount of data that is needed to address
and solve the particular problem or set of problems.
Finally, priorities must be established to support the safe and efficient movement of goods. The overall
goal of project planning is to identify the type of information to collect for analysis and how the
information is going to be collected. Once problems are identified, goals and objectives are defined, and
the required information to be analyzed is identified, the data must then be collected and will be
discussed in the next section.

2.2

Data collection and management

Data collection involves four primary types and sources of data, depending on the scope of the project:
quantitative data, intelligence gathering and stakeholder consultation, site visits, and freight data. This
section will briefly describe these types and sources.

Quantitative data collection
Quantitative data includes information related to freight volumes and trends. Some examples when
looking at freight movement by truck include:
•

Traffic volumes by vehicle class on major roads, along key freight corridors, and/or at cargo
origin points

•

Freight movements by economic sector, including origins and destinations

•

Land use in terms of freight generators and attractors

Intelligence gathering and stakeholder consultation
Consultation with local stakeholders should be pursued to identify characteristics of freight in an area
and land use issues affecting freight. Intelligence gathering should consist of two or more components,
namely stakeholder surveys, and workshops or public meetings. Stakeholder surveys should be
conducted to obtain data for the number of truck movements in and out of a facility (ideally by time of
day and day of week), key truck access and exit routes to a facility and issues along those routes,
operating hours (reception and expedition of goods), position in the supply chain, operational issues and
concerns, and plans for expansion where applicable. Workshops and public meetings should involve
stakeholder consultation to identify freight transportation issues.

Site visits
Site visits are an effective way to collect data on physical infrastructure and freight needs. They should
identify entering and exiting truck volumes for major transportation facilities during peak trucking hours,
areas of conflict for truck movements, illegal transit trough residential areas, respect of speed limits,
double-parking, high volume trucking routes, and multimodal interaction issues identified in stakeholder
consultations.

February 2021

33

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

Freight data
Finally, there are a few sources of freight-specific data that can be drawn upon in order to help
effectively plan a project. The sources include:
•

Automatic traffic recorder counts

•

Origin-destination surveys

•

Statistics Canada’s Trucking Commodity Origin and Destination Survey

•

Statistics Canada’s Canadian Freight Analysis Framework (CFAF)

•

American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI) truck GPS data

•

Ontario Ministry of Transportation’s Commercial Vehicle Survey

•

Canadian Centre on Transportation Data

•

StreetLight Data Inc.

Data collected can serve various functions in the project planning process. For example, it may help to
identify and measure the impact of freight on transportation infrastructure, or it may help with
integrated transportation planning that considers the needs of freight as a part of an overall multimodal
passenger and freight transportation system.
While there exist a number of sources for freight data, much of it comes from surveys that companies
voluntarily respond to – there is no obligation to provide data. Further, data can be inconsistent
depending on what private sector companies choose to disclose, and their methods for gathering and
presenting information. 52

2.3

Stakeholder consultation

Stakeholder consultation is a vital part of project planning and involves first identifying the stakeholders,
then assessing which tactic or set of tactics are best for engaging them. Public sector stakeholders
include federal, provincial/territorial, and regional governments, local municipalities, as well as elected
officials and other government regulatory agencies. Private sector stakeholders are more numerous and
varied, and include manufacturers, farms, retail stores, offices, freight facility operators, shippers,
carriers, 3PL companies, rail companies, and air and marine port authorities. Other stakeholders of
relevance include Indigenous peoples and local community members. Tactics to engage stakeholders
include online surveys, public open houses, in-person interviews, site visits, and workshops.

2.4

Analysis of current and future needs

Part of the project planning process involves understanding the current and future needs of the goods
movement network that will be affected. This analysis allows planners to better understand how their
projects will impact the overall movement of goods in an area, region, and beyond. The analysis includes
a look at supply and demand, infrastructure, regulation and policy, enforcement, and future needs.

2.4.1

Freight facilities – Supply and demand

The first step in this analysis involves identifying areas where the demand for freight services is located.
This includes locating employment areas, employment uses, commercial or mixed-use areas, and truck
34

February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

traffic. Next, the organization of specific supply chains should be understood in terms of the types of
resources involved, production methods and locations, consumption and distribution areas, major
players involved, and mode split of the area. This culminates in an analysis of current needs. GIS
mapping is recommended based on the data collected to show the location of freight assets (i.e., nodes
and freight centres), freight corridors, special facilities (i.e., warehouses, rail yards, intermodal centres,
and air/marine ports), and actual or planned infrastructure investments. Figure 2.4.1 below provides a
basic example of the results of mapping. GIS can also be used to analyze how many of these
components interact with one another from a spatial perspective.
Figure 2.4.1: Local freight mapping
(Source: Ontario Ministry of Transportation, 2016)

These first steps allow for planners to understand the demand for freight and thus the supply of goods
required to meet demand. Projects can then be targeted to limit the gap between supply and demand
and increase support of freight through further investment or policy changes to support safe and
efficient freight movements.

2.4.2

Infrastructure

Next, an analysis of existing infrastructure should be undertaken. This includes the number of lanes,
bottlenecks, functional classification of roads, connectivity and discontinuity. This analysis should
consider the strengths and weaknesses of the current transportation system. After determining the
strengths and weaknesses, consideration should be made for developing a strategic freight or truck
route network. The infrastructure analysis should include a review from capacity, network and
geometric perspectives, allowing planners to obtain a holistic understanding of the capabilities and

limitations of a given freight network, and will further allow them to identify priority projects that would
address any issues identified.

2.4.3

Policies, regulations and by-laws

To complete any project, planners and other stakeholders must understand not only the regulations in
the jurisdiction where the project is planned, but also those in neighbouring jurisdictions as they can
have an impact on the movement of goods across municipal, provincial and national borders. For
example, overweight/over-dimension restrictions, special seasonal allowances, and policies that address
freight movement needs and issues such as by-laws, can affect goods movement. Another example of
applicable by-laws are the time-of-day restrictions for delivery in urban centres or commercial avenues.

2.4.4

Enforcement practices

Associated with understanding policy and regulation is knowledge of the enforcement of these
regulations, not only towards freight but also to other road, air, rail and waterway users. It is important
to identify enforcement and violation issues in order to find appropriate freight-supportive solutions.
The intensity of violations and enforcement are also key pieces of information in this procedure. This
information is required to better understand problems faced by freight, and to identify potential
solutions.
For example, parking restrictions on road freight corridors and the intensity of their enforcement are
important pieces of information when developing a project as considerations should be made to ensure
that the level of enforcement is effective where restrictions exist, new restrictions should be considered
in the case where none exist to support the efficient movement of goods. Stakeholders and the public
(and site visits) can help to identify areas where conflicts may occur between freight and other road
users or land uses through consultation and data collection tactics presented in Section 2.3.

2.4.5

Analysis of future needs

Finally, with all this information gathered, an analysis of future needs can be undertaken. This analysis
involves an understanding of the information gathered showing current needs, and an identification of
planned capital investments. Once current needs are understood, forecasting can be undertaken for
employment and population growth. These forecasts can then be used to anticipate future trade
patterns and capacities on transportation networks through modelling activities described in Section
2.10, thus informing what projects should be undertaken based on the anticipated needs of the
transportation system.

2.5

Developing strategies 53

This section provides strategies for a number of project undertakings that are freight-supportive.
Considerations are made for both rural and urban applications, and the overall impacts of freight and
delivery on urban environments is briefly examined.

2.5.1

Developing strategic truck route networks

In developing a strategic truck route network, there are a number of useful strategies that can be drawn
upon which help to better understand the network, its components, and the requirements for
development/improvement. A strategic truck route network should be continuous and integrated with
adjacent municipalities to the greatest extent possible. The network itself should promote multimodal
connectivity for goods movement and include corridors that seek to expedite freight movements
through strategies such as increased speed limits, longer left turn lanes, and permissive signaling. The
network should also define different categories of truck routes including primary or major, secondary or
alternative, and restrictive routes. Finally, it is important to identify how the network will fit into the
existing major transportation trade corridors, as identified in Module 1. Strategies to develop the overall
network include:
•

Develop a functional classification of roads (e.g. expressway, arterial, collector, local)

•

Identify primary and secondary truck routes based on the functional classification and character
of the road, as well as the location of freight generators and receivers

•

Develop a coordinated truck route that:
o
o
o
o
o

Efficiently links current and planned freight intensive land uses to key inter-regional
transportation facilities
Provides access to commercial and employment areas within the municipality
Remove trucks from local and residential areas
Aligns with truck routes in neighbouring municipalities
Accounts for special freight needs such as accommodating long combination vehicles (LCV)
or exceptional load movements

•

Recognize that variations will exist for freight needs depending on land use types in an area

•

Identify context-sensitive strategies for complete streets that include considerations for freight

•

Identify areas where truck traffic should be discouraged or limited due to sensitive land uses
such as residential areas

•

Avoid or mitigate conflicts between truck routes and transit or cycling routes

2.5.2

Protecting corridors and employment areas

As the flow of goods by truck and rail increases, the importance of protecting, maintaining and
enhancing supporting infrastructure also increases. Interregional truck routes and corridors are key links
in providing businesses and consumers with just-in-time deliveries and door-to-door service from freight
distribution centres. Further, employment areas require freight connectors and new ones should be
located near existing freight networks and facilities.
Figure 2.5.1 below provides a theoretical example of employment areas with relation to freight
networks.

February 2021

37

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

Figure 2.5.1: Employment area locations
(Source: Ontario Ministry of Transportation, 2016)

Strategies for protecting corridors and employment areas include:

38

•

Identify and assess demand for freight infrastructure and potential infrastructure improvements

•

Include a policy section in a municipal official plan, transportation master plan, or secondary
plan that provides support and direction for local freight movement

•

Include provisions in local zoning by-laws including setbacks, loading zones, and ingress and
egress to support the needs of the freight industry

•

Identify and protect existing and planned freight corridors and facilities in planning documents
to increase the efficiency and quality of these routes

•

Prepare consistent and coordinated mapping of all major freight facilities and truck
routes/corridors within jurisdictional boundaries, including GIS layers for analysis

•

Protect industrial and/or commercial lands located near identified freight corridors to allow for
future freight movement facilities

•

Establish priority routes for freight movement, where feasible, to facilitate the movement of
goods into and out of significant employment, industrial and commercial sites

•

Discuss possible changes to local freight facilities and corridors or major trucking destinations
with freight stakeholders and neighbouring jurisdictions to receive input, ensure plans are kept
current, and allow for coordinated infrastructure investments where possible

February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices
•

Collaborate with neighbouring municipalities and freight stakeholders

•

Consider freight needs of all sites and identify uses that are freight-intensive

•

Coordinate major changes to inter-regional and international routes that affect neighbouring
municipalities, identify new routes, and agree on them before the projects that rely on the
change are approved

2.5.3

Increasing enforcement

Enforcement of restrictions, regulations, policies and by-laws is an important factor in ensuring the
safety and efficiency of a goods movement network within and across jurisdictions. By-law
harmonization is a key strategy that can help ensure a healthy freight network as it creates a consistent
environment for freight operators, enabling them increased ability to plan routes and reducing
unexpected costs and delays. Some examples of by-laws include loading/unloading area time limits,
parking time limits and area restrictions, and zoning for freight supportive land uses. It is also
recommended that signage be provided to indicate restrictions and corridors to help ensure routes,
requirements, and restrictions are clearly defined, increasing the likelihood they will be effective.

2.5.4

Truck bypasses

Truck bypasses are another feature in transportation networks that help ensure the safety and efficiency
of the overall system. They provide accommodation for right turning trucks, and provide additional
right-turn capacity without having to add lanes or roundabouts. On highways, truck bypasses separate
freight and passenger vehicles, thus reducing lane changing conflicts between faster moving cars and
slower moving trucks.

2.5.5

Truck parking

Truck parking is another important feature of the transportation network, also helping to ensure road
safety and operational efficiency. It was ranked as the fifth critical issue in the trucking industry in 2018
by ATRI. 54 Truckers, particularly those on long-haul trips or completing local deliveries, often have
difficulty finding available designated parking areas. Over 60% of truck drivers routinely have trouble
finding parking or places to rest while operating in Canada, often resulting in them violating HOS rules or
parking illegally. 55 With truck volumes growing, and parking supply already below demand, it is
important for provinces/territories and municipalities to explore options for increasing the availability of
truck parking off highways and on local roads.
ATRI identifies three strategies to help combat the lack of designated truck parking. First is identifying
strategic locations on the NHS for new or expanded truck parking. Specific actions that can be taken
after identifying locations include: re-opening closed facilities, investing in new facilities, and
repurposing vacant urban and suburban lots. The second strategy involves educating the public on the
safety consequences that result from a lack of designated truck parking facilities. When drivers are not
able to safely park to rest and perform other tasks, they risk spending more hours on the road and are
more likely to be involved in a collision. Finally, the third strategy involves researching the role and value
of real-time truck parking information availability and truck parking reservation systems. Leveraging
intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can help truck drivers better plan their routes and ensure that
they are able to find suitable and safe parking when they experience fatigue or in emergency situations.

2.5.6

First-and last-mile delivery and impacts on urban environments

Truck transportation is vital to the Canadian economy, as the majority of economic activities rely on the
movement of goods between locations. The “first and last mile” in freight refers to local pick-ups and
deliveries at businesses or residences. They are the first and last steps in the delivery process of a supply
chain, moving goods to carriers or couriers and customers as first- and last-mile respectively, and often
involve freight vehicles navigating dense urban environments. Increases in consumer choice for goods
(see Section 3.1.1) through increased availability online has led to increases in the sizes and frequencies
of shipments, due in part to the fact that online orders are often unrestricted by geographic location or
time of day. In addition, delivery timelines are increasingly shortening as some companies have begun
offering next-day or even same-day delivery.
First- and last-mile issues have grown in recent years due to factors including the growth of online
orders. Four primary issues with the first and last mile in freight relate to the volume of deliveries, the
geographic dispersion of pick-up and delivery locations, truck route restrictions, and cost of delivery. A
given business or residence can receive multiple deliveries a day from multiple sources. Small deliveries
to many dispersed destinations can generate complex routing issues, particularly when trucks face
route, time-of-day and parking restrictions. This may result in freight vehicles parking illegally or
blocking access/egress points. Further, home deliveries for small products are inefficient as they can be
transported by smaller vehicles, are in direct competition with the local delivery industry, and have a
high frequency. Failed deliveries are also common, and often require the delivery vehicle to return the
next day if there is no local distribution or pick-up facility. The typical result of this combination of issues
is an increase in congestion, particularly during peak periods and on major roadways where trucks face
no restrictions, and increases in travel time and overall costs for all road users, as well as increases in
pollution which negatively impacts public health.
In order to help combat these issues, freight villages (discussed in Section 3.1.6) and urban consolidation
centres (UCC) 56 can allow for the consolidation of pick-up and delivery locations, increasing efficiency
and decreasing the total time required to fulfill orders and therefore cost. UCCs are similar to freight
villages, though they are typically located near urban centres. Another potential way to address these
problems includes employing ITS and wayfinding to help drivers and carrier companies plan better
routes through real-time information. This is discussed further in Section 2.8. Strategies such as off-peak
delivery (discussed in Section 3.1.2) can also be explored to help ease road network and environmental
impacts such as congestion, as well as helping carrier companies and drivers plan the most cost-effective
routes during varied times of day. Finally, there are a number of other urban goods movement
strategies that can help to reduce the strain on the road network and negative impacts on urban
communities such as: use of delivery bikes (cargo cycles), scooters, and drones (ground or air);
underground delivery tunnel networks; increasing truck curb access and moving bus lanes away from
curbs; creating low emissions zones in select urban areas; vehicle redesigns that use smart technologies;
right-sizing of delivery vehicles; and vehicle retrofitting to increase driver visibility.

2.6

Evaluation tools 57 58

A key part of the overall project planning process is the evaluation of the proposed network investment.
There are a wide range of tools that exist to evaluate the potential benefits of proposed, and the
method selected depends on the stakeholder performing the assessment, as each value different types

40

February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

of benefits. Some potential benefits include transport equity, accessibility, travel time savings, and
monetary savings.
The first step for those evaluating projects should be an assessment of the benefits that project
stakeholders are interested in realizing. Next, an identification of potential tools should be conducted.
Table 2.6.1 below shows a select number of categories and different types of tools available within. The
majority of available tools fall under three main categories: cost-benefit analysis, risk analysis, or
strength-weakness-opportunity-threat (SWOT) 59 analysis.
Beyond the list of tools in the below table, there are also some documents that can be drawn upon for
further information. These include, but are not limited to, the National Cooperative Freight Research
Program’s Reports 12 60 and 22, 61 and the Victoria Transport Policy Institute’s What’s It Worth?

2.7

Integration with other disciplines

Goods movement does not exist in a vacuum. As such, there is a necessary amount of integration with
other disciplines in order to ensure the safe and efficient movement of the network and interactions
with other disciplines are positive and constructive for the overall network. The primary disciplines that
integrate considerations for goods movement are public health and environment, economic
development, emergency services and education.

Public health and environment
The integration of goods movement into the public health and environment discipline relates mainly to
emissions. In 2015, the transportation sector (including freight and passenger) in Canada accounted for
roughly 24% of overall GHG emissions in the country, and freight by rail, road, marine or air accounted
for 10.5% of total emissions in Canada. Freight transportation is expected to surpass passenger
transportation emissions by 2030. 63 Figure 2.7.1 below shows a breakdown of emissions by economic
sector. Staff in the planning process can look to the National Inventory Report of GHG Sources and Sinks,
Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators, and the Ministry of Environment and Climate
Change’s GHG emission regulations for example, in order to collect data on freight emissions and
understand the regulations surrounding emissions that impact the sector.
Figure 2.7.1: Breakdown of Canada’s emissions by economic sector
(Source: Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2018)

The safety of freight is also important, as unsafe practices from loading cargo to driving on roads can
have negative impacts on a range of individuals. Spills of hazardous materials are an example of unsafe
practices. Further, the healthcare system relies on the movement of goods to receive medical
equipment for patients. Without a safe and efficient goods movement network, the healthcare sector
may face risks of undersupply.

Economic development
Freight is also integrated into the economic development account in Canada, as the transportation and
warehousing industry not only contributes approximately four percent of overall GDP, 64 but it also

42

February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

interacts with nearly all other industries, as each rely on goods to be transported for that industry to
function. For example, the manufacturing industry contributes just over 10% of total GDP, but could not
without an effective goods movement network around it that allows for these manufactured goods to
be shipped within the country and to international trading partners. Freight also contributes to GDP
through import and export trade. Ensuring that goods can travel efficiently to port facilities within the
country to be exported internationally, and to bring international products to the Canadian market, is
important in ensuring the economic strength of the country.

Emergency services
Goods movement is also integrated into the emergency services discipline, primarily through safety,
specifically collision rates. 65 Planners should look at these rates and select for the types of vehicles
involved in order to understand how to improve the network through investment decisions, or other
mechanisms, that seek to improve the overall safety of the goods movement industry.

Education
Finally, goods movement is integrated with education. There are a number of safe driving programs in
Canada that seek to improve road safety and provide transport-related training to prospective drivers,
mechanics, dispatchers, and logistics experts. The Canadian Automotive and Trucking Institute, and
Transport Training Centres of Canada both offer courses to this effect.

2.8

Road design

When considering freight in the design of roads, considerations are similar in many respects to public
transit buses as the sizes of these vehicles and freight trucks are often comparable. There are three
primary categories that should be understood in order to better plan for, and enable the efficient
movement of goods: access and intersections, corridors and wayfinding.

Access and intersections / corridors
When incorporating freight into the design and operation of transportation infrastructure, specifically as
it relates to access and intersections, the acceleration and deceleration rates of trucks, how they
maneuver through off-ramps and curves, and how they handle downgrades should all be considered.
There are a number of strategies that can be drawn upon to help better incorporate truck requirements
into road design. For example, due to the slower acceleration and deceleration rates of trucks,
intersections should, where possible and justified by sufficient truck movement, have signal timings that
are adjusted to be sensitive to acceleration and deceleration requirements. This can be done by
updating signal timings for left turn phases, calculating signal timings using delay-based passenger car
equivalents, providing longer minimum phase timings for green and amber signals to accommodate
longer and fully-loaded trucks, and designing intersections to be located a minimum of thirty metres
away from railway tracks so that road vehicles do not extend onto them. Turn restrictions should also be
considered and should not restrict movements to main entrances of freight hubs, distribution centres,
and other areas with high freight volumes.
Acceleration lanes, off-ramps, and curves also require special considerations for freight vehicles due to
their speed and size. These include providing longer acceleration lanes based on truck weight-to-power

February 2021

43

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

ratios, through traffic speeds, truck speed upon entering the lane, and roadway geometry and installing
rollover and ramp advisory speed signs on curves and off-ramps.

Wayfinding
Wayfinding is another important element of road design that must consider freight. Municipalities
should establish truck routes that are as integrated as possible with neighbouring jurisdictions, and
provide clear and easily identifiable wayfinding tools for truck drivers. This can help to create a safer and
more efficient truck network, regardless of network complexity, density, or traffic volumes.
Municipalities and provinces/territories should seek to introduce truck routing information systems that
employ ITS technologies to disseminate truck routing information, including designated truck parking
areas. This includes static and dynamic signs, to be strategically placed throughout the network to
permit drivers to make routing changes, as seen in Figure 2.8.1 for example. Finally, signage that
provides guidance should be placed in positions to provide drivers with information when and where it
is needed in their journeys. The information should be repeated to ensure that it is noticed and should
be given in small digestible amounts to not distract drivers and maintain road safety.
Figure 2.8.1: Variable message sign
(Source: Ontario Ministry of Transportation, 2016)

Truck movement along corridors can be supported in a number of ways, and should seek to increase
reliability and improve safety. Some strategies related to improving travel time and reliability, capacity
and connectivity, all of which contribute to increasing safety and the reliability of operations of the truck
route network, include:

44

•

Provide paved shoulders to accommodate truck off-tracking. 66

•

Add capacity and improve safety by restriping lanes where possible.

•

Incorporate vehicle loop detectors and classifiers into signals on high-speed corridors to give
trucks priority and reduce number of stops.

February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices
•

Identify commercial truck routes for access to warehouses, distribution centres, intermodal
facilities, manufacturing facilities, quarries and other facilities involved in goods movement.

•

Increase bridge strength capacities and vertical clearances, and direct trucks away from lowclearance areas.

•

Employ variable message signs and travel time displays for example, particularly ahead of onramps for expressways to convey travel times and unexpected delays and incidents.

•

Minimize the use of strategies and infrastructure that place lane restrictions on trucks.

2.9

Site design 67 68

This section will explore guidelines and strategies for site design that are common to most sites and
therefore widely applicable. The primary land uses of relevance include industrial, office, retail,
institutional, urban areas, and rural sites. There will also be attention paid to trucks and their
interactions with other modes within these sites.

2.9.1

Common elements for all sites

The first design element that is common to most sites is crime prevention through environmental design
(CPTED). This is a design philosophy that promotes safety and crime prevention through proper design
and effective use of the built environment. 69 Incorporation of these design principles can help to
provide natural deterrents to crime including threats to people, damage to private property, and theft.
The next set of strategies relate to site access. In order for truck movements to flow efficiently, proper
access arrangements from external roads to all sites must be provided. Some key strategies to ensuring
accommodation of the anticipated types of trucks to particular sites include:
•

Design accesses to accommodate the turning radii requirements of trucks, and provide
adequate lane widths on site.

•

Provide adequate driveway lengths for access and egress of trucks.

•

Locate accesses appropriately in relation to intersections and consider providing exclusive
turning lanes for access where possible.

•

Provide signage on external roads to notify drivers of possible truck traffic and truck
access/egress points.

Loading docks and yards require additional considerations for truck movements as they are the arrival
and departure points for the ground transportation of goods. Determining the loading demands of the
site is an important first step in designing a facility and should include considerations for the types of
trucks required to meet the shipping needs of the site, frequency of shipments, truck time spent
loading/unloading, and building security issues. Some strategies for design of loading docks and yards
that should be considered are as follows:
•

Provide a ramp from the truck parking area up to the loading dock to facilitate deliveries from
smaller trucks, vans, and other vehicles.

•

Install bumpers on either side of the loading dock to prevent damage to vehicles and facility.

•

Cover open loading docks with a roof extending beyond the dock to protect goods and people
from poor weather.

February 2021

45

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices
•

Provide enough space for all required waste bins.

•

Separate loading docks from public entrances by locating them at the side or back of building.

•

Provide ample turning area to allow a truck to complete a three-point turn.

•

Provide a separate entrance where possible for smaller deliveries that do not require loading
bays.

•

Provide parking stalls for tractor trailer storage where required.

•

Ensure that the staging area is large enough.

•

Provide buffers around the loading dock yard in the form of walls, screens, and other
landscaping elements to shield the area from public view, reduce noise and light pollution, and
enhance security.

The final set of strategies relates to garbage facilities. These facilities should be accessible while
maintaining a level of discretion in order to reduce their impact on the surrounding areas. Strategies
include:
•

Design facilities with enough horizontal and vertical space to accommodate movement of
modern vehicles such as front-end loading vehicles.

•

Locate waste collection areas in the back of buildings or away from the street and main
entrance of building.

•

Centrally locate shared waste facilities in order to limit the number of facilities required on a
given site.

•

Provide buffers in the form of landscaping, screens, or walls to limit impacts on adjacent land
uses.

•

Employ CPTED principles to ensure safety of the facility.

2.9.2

Urban and rural areas

In urbanized areas there are many facilities that require freight, courier, and garbage services in order to
operate effectively, such as for retail shops, strip malls and mixed-use developments. Ensuring that
these services are able to serve urban locations can be challenging due to delivery requirements and
physical space restrictions, especially in historic downtown areas with narrow roads, tight turning radii,
and laneways. There are opportunities to create shared loading facilities in some high-density urban
areas to improve land use and freight efficiency. Example strategies to improve truck movements to
allow for the efficient and safe movement of goods in and out of the area are:

46

•

Create designated loading zones on-street when there is insufficient space for rear loading dock
yards.

•

Avoid the use of loading zone lay-bys (temporary parking areas) on streets with defined cycling
lanes.

•

Provide signage along streets indicating truck accesses.

•

Consider freight facility improvements as part of a community improvement plan.

•

Locate loading areas underground or at the rear of buildings, and make them accessible through
alleyways or low-volume side streets where possible to avoid conflicts with other modes.

February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices
•

Avoid conflicts with other modes by restricting truck parking on bike lanes and sidewalks, or at
transit stops.

In rural areas, site design should maintain the rural character of the surrounding area wherever possible.
This can be accomplished by setting facilities appropriate distances away from roads, using colours that
match the surrounding landscape, and adding buffers and landscaping. Signage notifying drivers of
possible truck movements, and turning lanes that provide access to rural sites will help to reduce delays
and improve safety. An example of site design in a rural area is provided in Figure 2.9.1.
Figure 2.9.1: Example of site design in a rural area
(Source: Ontario Ministry of Transportation, 2016)

2.9.3

Interaction with other modes

Site design must not only consider land uses and design principles, but also the interaction of trucks with
pedestrians, transit vehicles, cars, cyclists, and all other modes that use the road transportation
network. Truck access, parking, and all other movement should not restrict the movements of other
modes. On the other hand, trucks must also be able to safely and freely access facilities, at times
involving crossing transit or cycling lanes and pedestrian paths. Ensuring trucks can navigate the network
may involve creating turning lanes for left turns and U-turns, especially when transit is grade-separated
in the median of the road, providing off-road cycling paths where truck traffic is common along
designated cycling routes, and setting sidewalks away from curbs on roads with high truck volumes.
Balancing the needs of trucks and other modes is ultimately required to ensure that the entire network
operates efficiently. Some strategies that can be employed when considering interactions with other
modes on roads include:
•

Separate transit stops from truck parking areas to avoid conflicts.

•

Maintain adequate lane widths and curb radii at intersections for trucks to travel and turn.

•

Use far-side (after intersection) transit stops where possible to accommodate for truck turns at
intersections.

February 2021

47

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices
•

Provide bike lane markings, pavement markings, and signage to alert vehicles of bike routes.

•

Install truck access signs near major access points that may be hidden from the view of cyclists
or other road users.

•

Provide a buffer between the curb and sidewalk to increase pedestrian safety along truck
routes.

•

Install traffic signals, crosswalks, and pedestrian crossing signals at site access points that
generate high volumes to reduce conflicts between pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
Figure 2.9.2: Dedicated bike lane
(Source: Ontario Ministry of Transportation, 2016)

In addition to the on-road strategies, there are also some on-site strategies that can be employed to
further improve the ease of interaction between modes:

48

•

Locate transit stops away from loading dock yards.

•

Provide signage on-site to identify pedestrian paths to transit stops.

•

Ensure visibility for all road users is maintained at driveways and intersections.

•

Separate truck access routes from pedestrian and bike access routes.

•

Provide signage and ground markings to indicate on-site bike routes and parking.

•

Locate bike parking near entrances and in high-visibility areas away from loading areas.

•

Provide on-site pedestrian walkways.

•

Provide curb cuts at pedestrian crossings to ensure mobility along a path for all.

•

Ensure maximum visibility for trucks exiting facilities by providing mirrors and audible signals to
alert pedestrians of truck movements, and avoid designs that limit visibility.

•

Provide well-defined pedestrian crosswalks by using painted pavement markings, differentiated
pavement types, and pedestrian-oriented lighting.

2.10

Demand modelling 70 71

Travel demand modelling is a forecasting tool used to estimate travel behaviour and demand within a
given area and timeframe. Historically, travel demand models have focused largely on passenger
movements, despite commercial travel being an important activity for governments to understand in
order to prioritize infrastructure improvements and develop effective policies that encourage freight
traffic, while also limiting negative externalities. Recently, more consideration has been made to
incorporate freight into models as more data is becoming available for use, though many assumptions
still need to be made when developing models.

2.10.1

Uses of demand models

Demand models can be used by planners and policymakers to conduct an array of analyses to help
inform infrastructure improvements, land use and rezoning requirements, and policy for example. Types
of analyses that can be conducted using travel demand models include travel time and reliability
analysis, mobility pricing analysis, time of day and off-peak analysis, and commodity flow analysis. Each
type serves a different purpose, and can be employed by planners based on their needs.

2.10.2

Required data

The data required in order to successfully run a demand model are freight parameters of primary
interest. They include truck productions and attractions by land use, sector or trip purpose; truck trips
per day by truck type; truck trip lengths by truck type; truck trip time-of-day distributions; origins and
destinations; and truck volumes. These data, however, are not always readily available, and the data
required for a particular case is dependent largely on the type of model selected, the analysis to be
conducted, and location.

2.10.3

Types of models available

There are many model types available to employ to conduct the chosen analysis. Simple growth factor
models for example, forecast changes in freight demand due to changes in the level of economic activity
or other related factors. These can be classified based on historical traffic trends, or based on forecasts
of economic activity. Simple growth factor models based on historical trends can employ linear or
compound growth, depending on assumptions made on how freight flows grow.
Another type of model is a four-step travel forecast, which can be used to directly estimate road vehicle
travel or commodity flows. The four main steps in these types of models are: production and attraction,
distribution, mode split, and network assignment. In a road vehicle travel estimate, the mode split step
is typically omitted as the mode is already selected. In commodity flow estimates, truck conversion is an
optional added step that converts the commodity tonnage for road shipments into vehicle flows. A
sample flowchart of the two types of four-step models can be seen in Figure 2.10.1.
A third example is the cross-cascades model. Using spatial input-output modelling involving a household
and economic activity event, land use component, and transportation component, this model
simultaneously develops forecasts generated iteratively, of modal passenger and freight traffic volumes
on the transportation network, modal splits, population, and employment.
Finally, there are other categories of models, each with a few model types, presented in Table 2.10.1.

2.10.4

Data sources

As previously mentioned, data for use in freight demand models are not always easily available.
However, recently there have been improvements in data collection and dissemination within Canada
that can be drawn upon. Examples include the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario’s Commercial
Vehicle Survey, GPS data, the Canadian Freight Analysis Framework, and Statistics Canada’s
transportation data and information hub and Canadian transportation economic account.

2.10.5

Controlling factors affecting demand analysis and forecasting

There are many controlling factors that impact the demand analysis and forecasting of freight flows. For
example, economic structure, types of industries, personal consumption, changes in demographics,
industry diversification, and trade flows have a direct impact on how many freight shipments are
required and their frequency. Industry supply chains and logistics networks also have an impact through
the spatial distribution of networks, interactions between logistics players, and supply chain and logistics
trends both nationally and globally. Freight infrastructure also plays a role, based primarily on the
characteristics of supply, demand, and shipments. Freight traffic flows play a role and can affect
forecasting depending on the measurement and representation of flows, which can be by number of
vehicles, twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), weight or value of shipments.
Public policy and the private sector also have an impact that must be acknowledged. Key private-sector
decision makers play a critical role in contributing to decisions about what, how, when, and where
transportation services are used to move goods across the supply chain. Regulations such as safety, land
use, hours of service, and environmental regulations all impact freight flows. They may set restrictions of
routes, truck and load sizes and weights, and types of equipment used. Ultimately, the factors that
impact freight flows must be known to planners and modellers to enable performance of accurate
demand analysis and development of reliable forecasts for planning purposes.

2.10.6

Limitations

There are limitations to using travel demand models. The first and most important is data availability
and quality. Much of the data required is not generally available to planning agencies as it is owned by
trucking and logistics companies. Current and historical data on freight, especially truck movements, are
limited, though as the importance of the availability of this data is better understood, it is anticipated
that more sources will become available in the future. Model complexity is another limitation. Often
times, models are highly complex, require substantial data that may not necessarily be available, and
take a long duration to run. Finally, when using GPS data, there is a risk that the collection of data may
miss some shorter trips due to imprecision of the data.

Module 3: Trends and disruptors

This module presents the results of research of emerging trends and potential risks in the goods
movement industry. The overall purpose is to educate the audience on recent developments in the
industry that they should be aware of, and have the potential to take advantage of when planning and
delivering projects. It is also meant to educate the audience on what the current and emerging trends
are in freight to raise awareness of how and why certain companies make their decisions. Its major
sections are:
•

Emerging Trends

•

Technological Advancements

•

Risks

At the end of this module, the audience should be aware of advancements in the freight industry, the
benefits they bring, and the potential risks associated.

3.1

Emerging trends

The first category of interest explores some emerging trends related to the shifting behaviours of freight
industry stakeholders, policymakers, and consumers, and their impacts on production, distribution,
delivery and consumption.

3.1.1

Consumer options

Traditionally, consumers would shop at storefronts where goods are typically delivered through
traditional supply chains, during peak or off-peak hours. These traditional supply chains involve
producing and acquiring raw materials, transporting them via any combination of air, road, marine or
rail modes to warehousing, production and/or distribution centres, delivery to a brick-and-mortar
storefront, ending with consumer purchase.
With the rise of the internet, e-commerce has become a new option for consumers, shifting traditional
supply chains. Through e-commerce, consumers can make purchases that are not constrained by time or
geography – the primary requirement is an internet connection. This results in consumers being able to
order goods at any time, and have them shipped typically within a week, sometimes as early as within
the same day, requiring distribution centres that can manage large volumes of orders coming in 24/7
and can process and send them out for delivery within a day.
The continued rise of digital technologies has led to even more options for consumers, who can shop via
multiple channels (e.g. online websites, mobile phones, scanning barcodes, telephone orders).
Promotions and membership perks (e.g. Amazon Prime) are used to stimulate sales by offering limitedtime only deals during specific periods (e.g. Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Boxing Day), but also provide
the opportunity to receive the merchandise within the next 24 hours, creating higher volumes of
transport and deliveries during these periods. The supply chain after an order has been placed is
effectively identical to an e-commerce supply chain, with products being transported to warehouses
and/or distribution centres, then to smaller trucks for last-mile deliveries. This consumer purchase

February 2021

53

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

scheme requires a high level of integration between distribution, promotion and communication
channels, as purchases made from one location have the ability to be either picked up at the original
location, a secondary location, or delivered.
Ultimately, more consumer choice for ordering will likely lead to increases in the frequency of shipments
and/or larger shipments, putting increased stress on road infrastructure, and contributing to congestion
and pollution.

3.1.2

Off-peak delivery 72

Off-peak delivery (OPD) is an urban freight strategy that aims to alleviate congestion and road conflicts
caused by deliveries during peak periods, by moving them to off-peak periods, usually between 7:00
p.m. and 6:00 a.m. This strategy is not applicable in all jurisdictions, as some have delivery or noise
restrictions during certain overnight hours and near residential areas. However, where it can be tested
or implemented, OPD can:
•

Provide congestion reduction, particularly during rush hours in urban areas and on highways

•

Allow increased speeds when collecting/dropping off goods as loading bays are less busy

•

Increase quality of life for drivers who experience less driving-related stress

•

Increase the availability of parking and curbside space, resulting in a reduced likelihood of
parking tickets and increase in unloading options

•

Increase productivity for the receiving business as staff can be brought in early to stock shelves
before opening

Typically, shippers with large, high-volume customers who have the ability to receive shipments at night
are attracted to using OPD to fulfill their orders. However, small commercial, pedestrian, or touristic
streets in historic centres or downtowns also benefit from this strategy. This strategy requires receivers
to have overnight or early morning staff before opening hours, or technology to receive shipments
without staff present, both of which could have high costs – with staff costing more in the long run than
technologies – and therefore best suited for large shippers and receivers. Further, OPD is best suited for
non-perishable goods, rather than foodstuffs that can spoil. It is therefore useful for businesses such as
hardware stores or service stations.
Some difficulties and restrictions related to OPD include municipal noise restrictions; change
management issues (e.g. confusion with delivery times, switching warehousing staff to night shifts);
operational adjustments to deal with changes in working environments (e.g. requiring additional lighting
at receiving business, potential for unfavourable encounters with strangers); and a lack of a guarantee of
reduced travel times due to traffic signal timings and some areas maintaining relatively high volumes of
traffic throughout the day and night, particularly in urban cores.
OPD was piloted in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area during the Pan/Parapan Am Games in 2015
by MTO. Forty municipalities and over 100 retail, food and grocery businesses participated in the pilot
that resulted in approximately 18,400 off-peak deliveries during the Games. These diverted deliveries
are equivalent to the removal of approximately 4,500 truck trips or 240,000 truck vehicle-kilometres
travelled (VKT) from peak periods. While some noise complaints were received, the overall noise impact
was minimal. The study also found that minimal changes or costs are associated with businesses using
OPD, though this largely depends on the selected delivery schedule and current operating environment
of the business.

54

February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

The application of OPD will affect freight movement by reducing the number of vehicles travelling at
peak periods in urban settings and potentially on long haul trips as well. It may also help shippers meet
delivery deadlines better as there is less congestion to manage when planning routes.

3.1.3

Reverse logistics 73

Reverse logistics is identical to traditional logistics, except with the activities operating in reverse order.
It can therefore be defined as the process of planning, implementing and controlling the efficient, costeffective flow of raw materials, in-process inventory, finished goods, and related information from the
point of consumption to the point of origin for the purpose of recapturing value or proper disposal at
the end of the life cycle of the product. This includes processing returned merchandise due to damage,
seasonal inventory, restock, recalls, recycling and hazardous materials programs, and obsolete
equipment disposition, and is based on the retail industry’s “return policy.” Reverse logistics enable
businesses to retain more customers with “no-hassle guaranteed” and extract any remaining value from
returned products by reconditioning or recycling goods.
Reverse logistics affects the movement of goods by creating a continuous cycle of commodity flows that
may increase the amount of trucks on roads due to increases in demand for returns. Further, it can
contribute to stimulating further purchases which requires additional trips or heavier loads.

3.1.4

Increased terminal and truck / train / ship size

As global population continues to grow and people increasingly move into urban areas, digital
communications and technologies continue to connect people and businesses across the globe. As
global demand for goods increases, freight ultimately must keep pace and be able to transport the evergrowing amount of goods within and between countries. In order to keep pace, the sizes of ships,
airplanes, and port facilities, and the length of trains have all increased 74 – an example of which are the
expansion activities at the Port of Prince Rupert which are planned and/or are underway. 75 These size
increases contribute to changes in the processing and delivery patterns to and from major logistics hubs
such as marine ports, airports, and intermodal facilities, based on their capacity, forcing smaller
locations to try and increase their sizes to meet demand and stay competitive or risk terminating
operations. Moreover, due to physical constraints (depth of rivers and channels, available land-size, or
proximity to urban centres), a new hierarchy of marine port and airport terminals emerges into global
hubs or gateways, which can accommodate the largest ships and planes (for examples, the ports of
Hong Kong, Singapore, Rotterdam, Hamburg, New York/New Jersey; the airports of Tokyo, Shanghai,
Doha, London, Atlanta) who concentrate most of the trade and passenger volumes. Second-tier hubs are
dedicated to regional or national markets.
As sizes for port and intermodal facilities grow, so do their impacts on land use. This poses problems,
particularly in regions like Metro Vancouver and for its ports, as the demand for industrial land is
exceeding the inventory, which could potentially be exhausted in the near future. 76 It is therefore
imperative that land use planning be integrated with the transportation system in order for the
necessary growth in transportation facilities to be managed in a way that is sensitive to local and
regional development goals, and that zoning decisions are made with considerations for future demand
for varied land uses, including industrial lands. 77
Further, there have also been recent developments in maximum truck weights, with Manitoba for
example, increasing the maximum weight for semi-trailer tridem axles by 1,000 kilograms on select

February 2021

55

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

routes within the province. 78 While measures like this are helpful in ensuring both coordination across
jurisdictions, and the ability of Canada’s transportation network to handle the increasing demands of
consumers, there are also implications for wear and tear on roads that must be understood and
considered by planners and policymakers when updating regulations.
With regards to container ships, there has been a trend towards increasingly larger mega-ships which
require increasingly large mega-ports in order to offload. While the ability to carry more goods seems
good for carriers, and the ability to handle and offload large volumes is attractive for port facilities, the
overall cost savings for larger ships is actually decreasing as ship sizes increase, and costs to build and
maintain mega-ports are high. Approximately 60% of mega-ship cost savings are derived from more
efficient engines, not scale- and size-related fixes to existing infrastructure like bridges, waterway
widths/depths, canals, locks and other port infrastructure. Finally, mega-ships can lead to decreased
supply chain resilience through reduced carrier choice, and service and cargo concentration. Port
facilities and governments could take a few steps to help cover these increasing costs by making more
balanced decisions on accommodating mega-ships, aligning incentives and costs to public interests and
recover costs of mega-ships, provide policy support to ports to enhance supply chain productivity and
innovation, consider collaboration at a regional and cross-port level, and stimulate discussion between
shippers and transport stakeholders to better align on the use of mega-ships and optimize supply
chains. 79
Increases in sizes of travel modes and associated infrastructures is likely to increase the overall amount
of goods that can be shipped and received. This may make last-mile deliveries more difficult if truck sizes
are not decreased, or if more trips need to be taken. Long haul deliveries could however reduce in
number as larger trucks, trains, ships, and planes will be able to handle more goods with fewer trips.

3.1.5

The changing role of actors

The ownership and operational structures of transportation assets, including infrastructures, differs
between modes, and is subject to change. The basic ownership structure for each mode is presented in
Table 3.1.1 below, and is discussed in more detail in Module 1, Section 1.2 Modal Profiles.
Taking marine ports as an example, we see that some (e.g. remote, local/regional, and public) ports are
owned and operated directly by Transport Canada, 80 whereas Canada Port Authorities are Crown agents
that operate at an arm’s length from government. Canada Port Authorities are also financially selfsufficient, strategically significant to Canadian trade, linked to major rail or highway infrastructure, and
diverse in traffic. 81 These arm-length authorities have effectively depoliticized the decision-making
ability of these entities, increasing their ability to make and provide locally-sensitive decision and
solutions. 82

With the case of dry ports or intermodal facilities, using CentrePort in Winnipeg as an example, we see
the facility is privately owned and operated, yet still maintains a partnership with regional and provincial
governments. 83 Partnerships between private entities and the public sector are important for limiting
the uncertainty that comes with development projects due to factors such as funding sources.
Changes in these ownership/operational structures can have significant socioeconomic impacts. For
example, changes in ownership often lead to changes in priorities that may affect operations and
planned projects, as well as funding structures and access to capital, which could result in necessary
projects being cancelled, which may damage not only the local economy but the broader
provincial/territorial or national economies as well. On the other hand, transferring of ownership from
government to private companies could have positive impacts as investments no longer need to come
primarily or entirely from government budgets, which may have conflicting priorities, and much of the
risk is transferred to the private sector through contractual obligations to design, build, finance, operate,
and/or maintain roads on behalf of the government. 84 This shift to private financing helps to not only
shift risk but also to alleviate the public of their burden to cover capital costs of building and
improvements, though without strong partnerships with government, it is difficult to pursue capacity
improvements that involve expropriation of land. 85
As the roles and responsibilities of actors in the goods movement sector changes, the operation of the
overall networks can be affected in many ways. Depending on where responsibilities are shifted and the
resources that a particular entity has to accomplish these tasks, they may be easier and increase the
efficiency of the network, or may have the opposite effect.

3.1.6

Freight villages

A freight village (sometimes referred to as a dry port, inland port or intermodal facility) is a centrally
managed intermodal transfer point located at the nexus of multiple modes. At these locations, cargo
from different modes can be reloaded, compiled, and prepared for transportation. The concept of a
‘village’ is derived from the fact that multiple modes, transport companies, supplementary services, and
industrial and trading companies are all located in a cluster, promoting the division of labour on site.
There should also be access to shared facilities, equipment and value-added service.

February 2021

57

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

The benefits of freight villages can include:
•

Synergies in logistics processes

•

Synergies in infrastructure

•

Reductions in wasted movements and fewer transport links

•

Economies of scale

•

A firm basis for coordinated urban distribution

•

Encouragement of intermodal movement

The disadvantages of freight villages can include:
•

Co-located firms may not interact with each other, thus maintaining vertical supply chains as
opposed to horizontal coordination

•

Coordination between levels of government is at times difficult

•

Risk of over-supply if there are too many

•

Government subsidies in freight villages may not see positive returns

•

Villages may increase congestion in the area, as opposed to reducing it which is a stated goal

Finally, when firms choose their warehousing or distribution centres, they take into account a number of
considerations. Below is a table representing what firms believe is of high and low importance when
determining their location.

Freight villages allow for the consolidation of freight activities, which can contribute to effective land use
management. Further, goods movement stakeholders like shippers and carriers are better able to
interact with each other, reducing the number of empty runs between dispatching and picking up a load
at a distribution centre for example.

3.1.7

Social / public involvement

In recent years, there has been increasing social action and participation from local community groups,
individuals, and private-sector coalitions across the democratic world, exercising their rights of
association and freedom of speech in order to attempt to influence particular transportation
investments. This has resulted in protests, lobbying, rallies, and calls for action, the organization of
which has been facilitated by social media and the internet more broadly. In Canada, associations like
Trajectoire Québec, Transport Action Canada, and CargoM work with industry and the public to
influence transportation policy decisions, in efforts to increase environmental and consumer protection
and industry growth.
Examples can be noticed from national to local scales. In France for example, the ‘gilets jaunes’ (i.e.,
yellow vest movement, a group of primarily working-class protesters) began protesting increases in fuel
tax, rallying supporters in all of France, arguing that it is putting undue stress on their budgets and
accessibility within their regions. 86 In Toronto, there have been local communities of active citizens,
sometimes referred to as NIMBYs (i.e., not in my backyard), 87 objecting to mixed-use development
projects, and ultimately urban intensification, attempting to influence the development of their
neighbourhoods. 88 Elsewhere across Canada, national, provincial, and territorial protests against the
Trans Mountain Pipeline, a key piece of infrastructure ensuring Canadian oil can continue to be exported
and increase the competitiveness of its price against other countries’ oil, have taken place primarily to
criticize the potential environmental impact of the continued use of fossil fuels and potential
environmental damage. 89
Ultimately, land use, economic development and urbanization are intertwined and can have a significant
impact on the movement of goods and other aspects of the freight industry. Social, environmental, and
economic impacts of planning and investment decisions must therefore take these all into account,
weighing costs and benefits, and articulating these clearly to the public in order to gain the needed
support to see a project through. Further, social involvement can help to sway public policy or private
enterprises towards a particular action. For example, OPD might be pushed by policymakers; however, if
the public is not supportive, they have the potential to pressure the government to remove this policy.
This is particularly effective for urban freight but less so for long haul, as long haul typically involves less
interaction with the public.

3.1.8

Vision zero 90 91 92 93 94

Vision zero is a term originally coined by the Swedish government in 1977 when it launched its program
to eliminate death and serious injury from its roads. Since then, a number of organizations and
governments have adopted the term and launched their own plans to reduce or eliminate road-related
injuries and deaths.
The transportation sector (passenger and freight) accounted for roughly 2,000 annual deaths and
approximately 28,000 annual hospitalizations in Canada between 2010 and 2016, with large trucks
having a fatality rate double that of all other vehicles. By 2017, the number of fatalities per 100,000
population was five – the lowest on record. Within the trucking industry, many drivers and other
stakeholders feel that many of the accidents and fatalities involving trucks are a result of long shifts,
inadequate pay, and inadequate training.
In part as a result of the success seen in Sweden, who cut road deaths in half over twenty years,
jurisdictions across the world are beginning to implement their own Vision Zero policies in an attempt to
February 2021

59

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

see the same success. The Swedish model for Vision Zero as it relates to planners involves creating a
safe systems approach, rather than a shared responsibility paradigm in which education, enforcement,
and engineering are the structural pillars. Under the safe systems approach, the government (the entity
that designs the system) assumes full responsibility in developing infrastructure, vehicle regulation, and
speed limits that are designed to protect all road users, and particularly those at higher risk such as
pedestrians.
In Canada, Vision Zero was officially adopted nationally in 2016 as part of Canada’s Road Safety Strategy
2025. As of 2019, Vision Zero has been implemented across the country at varying levels of government.
Toronto, British Columbia, London, Montreal, Edmonton, Strathcona County, the Canadian Council of
Motor Transport Administrators, Manitoba, Durham, and Peel Region have all implemented some form
of Vision Zero in their jurisdictions. Other jurisdictions across the country are considering or preparing to
implement their own Vision Zero policies as this strategy is increasingly recognized as the international
best practice for road safety.
Strategies that can be employed to ensure that a safe systems approach is taken include: focusing on
what causes safety rather than what causes accidents; implementing road safety improvements in
bundles rather than as individual measures; ensuring the road network is safe at all points, and
improvements are not only targeted at high risk points; and embracing multimodal transportation.

3.2

Technological advancements / freight disruptors

There are a number of technological advancements that can be deployed throughout the freight
industry, from vehicles to infrastructure to warehousing, to increase safety and efficiency. However,
while promising, these technologies also come with risks and practical limitations that must be
understood and explored in order to help inform policy for how to allow the testing and application of
these technologies.

3.2.1

Connected and automated vehicles (CV/AV) 95

Connected vehicles (CV) use various forms of connectivity to extend a vehicle’s awareness beyond its
physical limits and enable communication between vehicles, transportation infrastructure, mobile
devices, and cloud computing platforms. It is important to note that the connectivity of the vehicle does
not necessarily imply that it is controlling vehicular movements. In the majority of cases with CVs, the
connectivity manifests itself as data-sharing between vehicles, pedestrians and infrastructure, sharing
information like vehicle speed, safety, signal timing and environmental conditions.
Automated vehicles (AV) are capable of using sensors, camera systems, artificial intelligence, and global
positioning systems to sense their environments and navigate without the need for human input. The
Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has defined six levels of automation for driving systems. The six
levels span from no automation (level 0) to fully automated operation (level 5), and are described in
Figure 3.2.1. A specific vehicle can have systems that span multiple automation levels, depending on
which systems are enabled.
The implementation of CVs and AVs, particularly in association with each other, is believed to result in
safer, more efficient road networks due to increased communications between users and the
elimination of human error. While in theory, a fully connected and automated transportation network
would likely improve efficiency and safety while reducing the need for new major infrastructures, this
60

February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

reality is still many years away. In reality, these technologies are slowly being adopted and integrated
into a still human-centric road transportation network, and are still not ready to be fully deployed across
all road and weather conditions. There are also medium-term risks of increased private vehicle
ownership, which will put more cars onto the road and increasing congestion levels. There are however,
other applications of these technologies, including for maintenance and warehousing, that are likely to
realize greater benefits sooner than the overall road transportation network.
Figure 3.2.1: SAE levels of vehicle automation
(Source: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2019)

CV/AV testing is being pursued in Canada, with a major testing hub located in Stratford, Ontario. The
Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN) is a demonstration zone and research and
development facility that focuses on testing AVs in real-world scenarios. AVIN’s core objectives include
commercialization of CV/AV technology, building awareness of the technologies and their place in
Ontario, and encouraging collaboration and innovation. 96 Land- and air-based AVs are also beginning to
be explored for farming applications such as seeding and crop analysis respectively in Alberta. 97

3.2.2

Platooning

Platooning is defined as linking two or more vehicles in a convoy, using connectivity and automation
technologies, to enable safe high-speed travel of what are effectively road freight trains. The application
of connectivity and automation allows the head of the platoon to act as the leader, while the trailing
vehicles adapt to changes in its movement by wireless sensors, but ultimately regulate their own speed,
distance, and movement based on the head vehicle. Drivers are able to take control of their vehicles at
any time to detach from the platoon to exit a highway and continue to a distribution centre for example.
The Government of Canada is in partnership with industry and other jurisdictions to test a vehicle-tovehicle-based cooperative truck platooning system. 98 Platooning has already been tested on public

February 2021

61

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

highways in Canada, with the first two-vehicle heavy-duty transport truck test having taken place
between 29 October and 2 November 2018 on highways around Montreal, La Tuque, Trois-Rivières and
Blainville, Quebec. 99
Platoons are an opportunity for truck drivers to increase their productivity as they can perform other
tasks while part of the platoon, increased safety through immediate and automatic braking, and
reductions in emissions and fuel consumption. On the other hand, there are safety risks that come with
any connected or automated vehicle technology, specifically related to their vulnerability to hacking,
which could ultimately result in vehicles being remotely controlled by hackers. Further, as with most
technologies requiring the development of complex algorithms that respond to real-world inputs in realtime, there is the potential for a malfunction, which could result in platoon vehicles losing connection
and colliding with each other or other road vehicles.

3.2.3

Long combination vehicles 100 101

Long-combination vehicles are trucks that are between 25-40 metres long and haul two full-sized
trailers. They are meant to replace two 23-metre tractor-trailers in order to reduce GHG emissions and
VKT, and increase safety, while also allowing retailers and manufacturers to bring goods to market at a
lower cost. Though not an entirely new solution, the adoption of LCVs in the trucking industry has been
slow due to mixed sentiments primarily surrounding the safety of their operations. 102 Others within the
trucking industry cite a lack of enforcement of regulations and public skepticism for sharing roads with
increasingly large freight vehicles. 103
Governments in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec are supportive of their use, and have set
up regulations related to routes, speeds, the nature of loads carried, and additional driver qualifications.
There is also a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Respecting a Federal-Provincial-Territorial
Agreement on Vehicle Weights and Dimensions signed between all provinces and territories and
Transport Canada to ensure the standardization of heavy-duty vehicle size regulations across the
country. This helps ensure that truck drivers can operate seamlessly between the provinces and
territories. This MOU is actively amended by the Council of Ministers Responsible for Transportation and
Highway Safety to respond to changes in jurisdictional regulations and advancements in technology. 104
There is also an MOU between the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick to
harmonize permit conditions for LCVs. 105
As a result of these MOUs, provinces who have historically not allowed LCVs, or have limited their
operations, have begun running pilot projects to assess their operational safety on their respective
highways. 106 107 Further, there are opportunities to combine CV/AV technology in LCVs to further
improve their safety and efficiency, though there are limited examples of these two trends being
combined and tested. 108

3.2.4

Alternative fuels 109 110

Alternative fuel vehicles are those whose engines are not powered solely, or at all, by petroleum.
Government and private-sector vehicle fleets have increasingly been using alternative fuels in order to
lead the way domestically in promoting a shift away from fossil fuels, and general consumers have also
begun to slowly make the shift, with the sales of electric vehicles in Canada growing 68% between 2016
and 2017. 111

62

February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

There are a wide variety of alternative fuels including biodiesel, electricity, ethanol, hydrogen cell,
compressed and liquified natural gas, and propane. Some benefits of these different types include
significant reductions in emissions; increased safety of using, handling, storing, and transporting these
fuels as compared to gasoline; increased power and performance of fuels like ethanol with higher
octane ratings than gasoline; increased energy efficiency; and improved engine life and reductions in
cold-start problems with propane. There are, however, concerns related to capital costs, retrofitting or
renewal of fleets, increased concentration of emissions with natural gas, and most importantly range of
these vehicles, specifically electric vehicles.
While there are many alternative fuel sources available, and production of vehicles that do not run on
gasoline is increasing, the freight industry has not adopted this trend in a large way as of yet. There are,
for example, electric trucks being produced in Canada, 112 and select Canadian companies like IGA and
Fortigo Freight Services Canada are testing electric trucks and delivery vans. 113 114 UPS Canada is also
involved in the adoption by converting its fleet to alternative fuels and testing plug-in electric delivery
vehicles, with a goal of reducing its global GHG emissions 12% by 2025. 115 116 Finally, Petro Canada
offers alternative fuels at select stations across the county. 117
With relatively low fuel prices, however, the incentive from the trucking industry to begin upgrading
fleets is low especially when there are no subsidies available, as capital costs are high. Similarly, though
it is unlikely that alternative fuels will reach air and marine freight, rail freight has seen increases in
electrification, which is a suitable fuel source when the electricity comes from renewable sources.

3.2.5

Intelligent transportation systems 118

Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are a combination of information and communications
technologies used in transportation and traffic management systems to improve the safety, efficiency,
and sustainability of transportation networks, reduce traffic congestion, and enhance drivers’
experiences. ITS provides information to road users, enabling them to use routes most efficiently, and
can be integrated with CV technology in vehicle platoons. Other applications include travel time
displays, alternative routing options, time restrictions, and construction/collision information
disseminated to road users. Figure 3.2.2 provides six examples of ITS applications for traffic, lane,
parking, and intersection management. With this information increasing in availability to the freight
industry, and more specifically to truck drivers, the possibility to enhance the safety, productivity, and
mobility of ground transportation while also reducing negative impacts like pollution and congestion, ITS
can have a significant positive impact on the freight industry.

Governments responsible for road transportation are increasingly applying ITS to their networks to solve
problems and meet their own goals. Further, ITS Canada, in collaboration with the National Research
Council of Canada and other stakeholders are in the process of developing a Canadian ITS ecosystem,
citing ITS as the nervous system of the transportation sector. 119 In Alberta, ITS is employed through
various technologies including the Smart Roadside Inspection System, which identifies high-risk
commercial vehicles from the side of the road. 120 ITS is also being further implemented in the Northwest
Territories as part of their Intelligent Transportation System Plan. This five-year implementation plan
with a budget of $3.5 million will deploy traffic counters, road weather information systems, road web
cameras, and variable message signs (see Figure 2.8.1) for example. The plan also includes the
development of programs to support and improve data collection and management of goods, including
dangerous goods. 121 Finally, the Government of Canada announced an investment of $6.9 million in the
modernization of ITS along Yukon’s trade corridors. Technologies include Road Weather Information
Systems and commercial vehicle operations support. 122
While ITS has many perceived and proven benefits, there are also some challenges to its deployment. As
with many other emerging technologies, the primary driver of ITS is data – this involves the collection
and distribution in order to inform the system. As a result, there are privacy implications, potential
issues with data formats and interoperability between different stakeholders, and rural and suburban
applications. Ultimately, if the data cannot be successfully standardized and secured, the application of
ITS systems to help solve transportation issues and create a more integrated network may not be fully
realized.

3.2.6

Electronic logging devices 123 124

An electronic logging device (ELD) is a piece of hardware that is attached to a commercial motor vehicle
engine in order to record driving hours. It captures data on whether the engine is running, whether the
vehicle is in motion, total distance driven, and duration of engine operation. Transport Canada and the
Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators developed a set of technical standards for ELDs,
with an initial version of the applicable regulations being released in 2017. It is expected that the full
Canadian mandate will largely mirror that of the U.S. to promote interoperability between the countries,
and is expected to require compliance by the end of 2020.
The move to mandate ELDs in Canada is aligned with the mandate in the U.S., which was fully
implemented at the end of 2017. The goals of these mandates are to increase industry safety,
productivity, and prevent driver log errors. While there are fleet and driver benefits associated with the
implementation of ELDs in the trucking industry including increased productivity and accountability
through eliminating paperwork for example, there are also perceived issues. ATRI’s annual trucking
industry survey ranked the ELD mandate in the U.S. as the fourth most important issue of 2018. This is
due to data collection and use concerns voiced by drivers who are unsure if and how the data collected
will be used beyond logging hours of service.

3.2.7

3D printing and warehouse automation 125 126

A significant technological advancement in the manufacturing and warehousing sectors is automation,
specifically automated processes of production, assembly, storage, and distribution. 3D printing, also
known as additive manufacturing, is an extension of automated manufacturing allowing for micromanufacturing or large-scale manufacturing of products, supporting local growth, and reducing VKT
through decreased need to transport many different materials to a single location for production or
assembly.
The 3D printing process is relatively simple – a digital model is created, the materials are fed into the
printer, and the printer produces the desired object. Some key advantages include shorter lead times;
the freedom to design and manufacture complex and customizable products particularly in the medical
equipment industry; a lower number of production steps in design, prototyping, and manufacturing;
potentially faster delivery times due to on-demand and decentralized production; reduced logistics and
production costs; and potentially lower environmental costs as production is efficient in material and
energy use. On the other hand, disadvantages and challenges to the efficient use of 3D printing include
the high cost of the printers, a limited number of suitable materials for production, limited suitability for
mass production, and job losses in the manufacturing sector. The University of New Brunswick created a
Marine Additive Manufacturing Centre of Excellence in 2017. It is focused on the research and
development and commercialization of parts, and is the first facility of its type to use 3D metal printing
to manufacture certified parts for the marine industry. The technology itself can help to address some
unique challenges of the marine sector including corrosion and time-sensitive access to complex and
critical spare parts. The facility ultimately seeks to help revolutionize the industry and allow Canadian
fabricators to manufacture components on demand and simplify supply chains. 127
Warehouse automation is the use of automated equipment during the production and storage
processes, including shelving, inventory checks, classification, and preparation for delivery. Automated
warehouses help to increase safety, efficiency, and accuracy of operations due to reductions in human
error. It is effectively an optimization of warehousing procedures and can affect most aspects of

February 2021

65

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

operations. While increases in safety, efficiency, and accuracy can lead to reductions in long-term costs,
there are also drawbacks from the application of this technology. For example, automation will result in
job loss as machinery will replace people for many tasks, and short-term capital costs for introducing
new machinery or building new automated warehouses is often high. Sobeys, one of the country’s
largest supermarket chains, began the automation of its distribution centres in 2010. As of 2018, the
company operates four automated distribution centres in Vaughan, Montreal and Calgary. According to
Sobeys, one robot in its automated facility can do the work of four humans. 128
Ultimately, pairing both warehouse automation and 3D printing with freight villages has the ability to
increase their overall efficiency, especially when dealing with on-demand and decentralized production,
as is the case with many new business models. This will allow for products to reach markets quicker, and
increased accuracy can result in less frequent trips for product returns for example, reducing freight VKT
and emissions.

3.3

Risks

3.3.1

Reconstruction of infrastructure

In many transportation networks across Canada, the physical infrastructure is deteriorating and needs to
be rehabilitated or reconstructed in order to not only maintain current operations, but also to be able to
handle future demand. While infrastructure upgrades may seem initially like the most obvious and
easiest ways to meet current and future demand, or minimize negative impacts that sections of the
network may be having on society, this is not necessarily the case. Government agencies are operating
with limited budgets, government priorities can change before and after elections depending on the
results, and major projects require extensive planning over many years and coordination between
various actors throughout the process. 129 This then presents problems related to finding funding sources
for projects, which will also have some negative impacts on the network during the construction period.
Government programs that provide incentives or subsidies, like Transport Canada’s National Trade
Corridors Fund, help to prioritize major investments and make the most effective use of resources in
order to improve Canadian freight corridors which help ensure access to markets both within and
beyond Canada. However, there is a limit on how much new infrastructure can be built, due to
conflicting land uses. Other forward-thinking and innovative congestion and emission-control methods,
like mobility pricing, should be explored for future use.

3.3.2

Aging workforce and retirements

Across the Canadian workforce and broader population, the average age is increasing and the number of
retirees is increasing. Fifty years ago, there were 6.6 workers for every retire; currently that ratio is four
to one, and in another 20 years is expected to drop to roughly two to one. 130 In the trucking industry, it
is anticipated that there will be a shortage of roughly 33,000 drivers by 2020, reflecting both an increase
in the demand of truckers and a decrease in their supply. 131 The trucking workforce is aging more rapidly
than the overall Canadian workforce, with a projected average age of 49 years by 2024, up from 44
years in 2006.
As the workforce ages, younger generations of workers find themselves more attracted to other
employment opportunities. The trucking industry is often synonymous with long-hours, stress for

66

February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

meeting delivery schedules, time lost in chronic traffic, health and back problems, and being away from
home for long periods and, unless there is a significant shift in the actual paradigm of production and
consumption as mentioned previously in the shifting behaviour section, there is a real threat to the
industry and broader economy as an insufficiently sized workforce can result in delays in deliveries.
There are, however, opportunities presented by new trends and technologies like automation,
platooning, and LCVs that can help to ensure the same amount of goods can be transported using less
drivers.

3.3.3

Competition 132 133

Competition in the freight industry is well-pronounced, as maritime ports, intermodal hubs, and airports
all contribute to the economic development of the region in which they are located and infrastructure
can supply superposing hinterlands (i.e. regions laying inland from the coast or far from urban areas).
For example, the Port of Montreal, with 60% of its rail cargo moving to the U.S., is in direct competition
with ports like New York/New Jersey, Norfolk, and Charleston in the eastern seaboard hinterland. As a
result, local and regional authorities are frequently seeking to increase their capacities to be able to
handle more goods and drive more calls to the port. Competition is not only local or regional to attract
major freights players and investments, but also national or global.
Some actions that ports have taken include providing cargo-handling services, investing in operating
terminal equipment and other technological upgrades, and directly employing dock labour to attract
routes from major shipping lines. On the local scale, logistics companies are also starting to move their
operations closer to these hubs where possible, creating freight villages, allowing them to take
advantage of other supply chain services, putting neighbouring cities in competition for tax incentives,
land provision, or direct access to highways, as seen by the 2017-2018 case of the competition to attract
the future Amazon headquarters in North America. Local and regional authorities should seek to ensure
that there is adequate industrial land for these villages and hubs to develop to better support the local
and regional economy.
Further, there have been increases in the involvement of global actors in port and railway activities such
as transnational terminal operating companies and international shipping lines. This has resulted in part
in the ports which they interact with increasing their value and volume of goods handled, and with
efficient railway services that can extend their geographical coverage and offer continental transport
solutions, putting traditional gateway ports and cities in competition – such as New York/New Jersey,
Norfolk, or Savannah in the eastern U.S.
The increase in competition has also led to a rise in the creation of hubs, freight villages and the like, in
order for regions to be able to better compete globally, as international trade is a major component of
goods movement in our increasingly interconnected and global supply chains. Hubs and major players
(e.g. shipping lines, terminal operators, railways) may lead to the loss of control by local authorities on
the overall operations, and declines in local participation. Further, multinational corporations may be
able to buyout operations in certain smaller regions, which is at times attractive to governments as it
implies a new source of revenue and reductions in annual operating costs, as well as increases in their
competitive standing against other ports. Ultimately, it seems that competition between ports, airports
and cities is increasingly characterized by competition between transnational operating companies who
have the resources to increase throughput with investments in equipment and technologies, and with
efficient delivery systems and national coverage, which can choose to supply markets from outside their
original infrastructure location.

3.3.4

Externalization of costs and benefits

Externalized costs and benefits (also called externalities) are unintentional outcomes resulting from the
use or consumption of a given service. These costs and benefits are external because they indirectly
affect those other than service users. In terms of external costs, it is important that planners understand
the different costs associated with investment decisions, and use policy and other tools to ensure that
users and industry players pay their fair portion of the impact they leave on the environment and
society. It is becoming increasingly important to share the costs and benefits within communities as
more governments explore the concept of equity in transportation.
External costs from freight include pollution (uncovered environmental costs), congestion and delays
(delays/time costs imposed on others), and infrastructure wear and tear (uncovered infrastructure
costs), each of which are attributable primarily to road transportation, as this is the dominant mode for
freight and the one that interacts most with actors from beyond its own industry.
Table 3.3.1 provides a simple classification of the costs of transport. In market economies, it is important
for policy makers and planners to know the external costs of decisions, because if market prices do not
accurately reflect the true social costs, there should be mechanisms in place in order to better distribute
the externalities.
External benefits from transportation include productivity and economic growth, and depending on the
mode and fuel source used, could also have neutral or positive impacts on the environment and public
health due to potential reductions in VKT, road wear, emissions or increases in active transport for
example.
Tools to combat negative externalities include user-based charges, toll roads and other road pricing
mechanisms, 134 taxation (such as fuel or vehicle characteristic taxes), 135 and carbon market and
pollution permits (similar to a cap-and-trade system). 136 There is no single tool that is effective at
capturing all externalities and internalizing them, nor is any tool that works well in one region
necessarily good for another region. Each must be studied and applied contextually in order to
internalize as much costs and benefits as possible, which will then contribute to influencing consumer
and industry behaviour.

Security

There are a number of security risks within the broader goods movement sector that exist locally,
nationally, or in combination. All transportation modes face considerable security and safety risks, with
some being shared between modes, others being unique to a particular mode, and others that are
linked specifically to a given technology.
For instance, the transportation of dangerous or oversized goods in urban areas, particularly building
materials and gasoline, poses significant risks to the local community and environment should there be
an accident resulting in a gasoline spill. 137 Dangerous goods are often also transported by rail, which has
in the past resulted in derailments, spills, fires and explosions. In response, Transport Canada has
removed many of the least crash-resistant tank cars from service and introduced new safety
standards. 138
Air and marine modes are especially susceptible to crime and terrorism events, particularly at port
facilities. Transport Canada’s Transportation Security Clearance Program aims to prevent unlawful acts
of interference within the operations of freight by these modes, in order to minimize the potential risks.
There are also numerous roadside inspection stations for trucks to ensure that they are not carrying
illegal goods, and are following other regulations including weight and size restrictions.
Planners should be aware of local and national security risks when evaluating projects, and should
always seek to employ CPTED principles and the highest possible safety requirements while not
inhibiting operations, in order to ensure the highest level of safety and security.

3.3.6

Cross-border freight traffic 139

The next risk relates to freight that must cross international borders to access its intended market. Due
to trade agreements like NAFTA (replaced by USMCA), CETA and CPTPP; increased interconnectivity
between producers and consumers from different countries; and the ease of movement between
countries by various modes, cross border freight traffic has increased in recent years. The result is that
more goods need to cross international borders, and carriers/shippers must then efficiently and
February 2021

69

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

successfully navigate complex customs procedures, or else risk fines, delays and lost revenues. Further,
operational differences between countries result in shippers needing to understand many different
structures to ensure their goods can reach their intended location.
On the other hand, in 2018 there was an increase in tariffs from some countries including the U.S.,
which increases costs for Canadian companies and consumers, and could reduce the overall volume and
value of cross-border freight traffic in the future if they remain or intensify.
In order to help mitigate these risks, new markets should be explored and trade corridors identified in
Module 1 should be targeted to increase efficiency and links to favourable trading partners for example.

3.3.7

Urbanization

Urbanization represents a shift of populations from rural to urban areas, particularly cities, and
therefore includes the intensification of urban areas. In 2018, 55% of the world population lived in urban
areas, compared to 82% of the North American population. 140 Increased intensification of urban areas
can result in increased wear and tear of transportation infrastructure, rezoning of lands to increase
housing but decrease industrial lands, and increased demand for the delivery of goods, thus potentially
increasing emissions and pollution through increased VKT.
Increasingly, large urban centres with adequate resources, space, and economies are becoming global
city regions – vast urban logistics hubs with broad global reach. These may incorporate freight villages to
serve logistics needs in a centralized location, and include immediate access to port facilities, intermodal
hubs, and rail and road corridors.
While global city regions are a potential benefit of urbanization when managed correctly, urbanization
still poses significant risks to the freight industry, particularly as it relates to the concentration of
activities in congested areas and last-mile deliveries. It is difficult for trucks and other large vehicles to
navigate often crowded and narrow streets present in urban cores, and the volume of consumers and
their demands must be able to be met now and into the future as they increase. There are, however,
opportunities for alternative delivery methods in urban areas like drones, bike couriers, and sidewalk
delivery robots that seek to solve the last-mile challenge of cities in a sustainable manner.

3.3.8

Climate change 141 142 143 144

Climate change has become a defining global challenge for the 21st century, impacting individuals on
every corner of the planet. There is a growing global consensus that human activity from the Industrial
Era to the present has been the primary cause of the increased GHG emissions that are associated with
climate change. In Canada in 2017, the transportation sector (passenger and freight) accounted for
roughly 24% of national GHG emissions, with freight accounting for approximately 41% of all
transportation-related emissions.
Climate change has been recognized by global institutions like the United Nations and World Bank as a
problem requiring collective action, and governments like Canada’s are taking steps in order to reduce
emissions and limit the negative impacts. Some of these impacts include: rising sea levels; decreased
water level in navigation channels lakes, and rivers; increased surface temperatures; loss of permafrost;
increased wildfires, droughts, and heatwaves; infrastructure failures; and the intensification of natural
disasters. These impacts can have adverse negative effects on the broader transportation system, and
freight specifically. For example, as all transportation is climate-sensitive, isolated communities in the

70

February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

north are particularly at risk for adverse climate effects as the supply of consumer goods and
construction materials may be interrupted. This can be caused by the melting permafrost and increased
surface temperatures for example, which can limit the viability of winter roads, cutting a key resource
supply route for these communities. Moreover, decreases in river water levels will have an impact on
depth and, therefore, the size of ships that can access inland ports through the St. Lawrence Seaway.
There may, however, be some positive impacts of climate change in northern regions. This is particularly
related to increased marine access with the melting of icebergs, and the future opening of the
Northwest Passage, potentially cutting travel time for sea shipping from Europe to Asia and increasing
the use of the Port of Churchill as a hub for ships in the area. This increased access as a result of rising
water levels can, however, cause a number of other problems.
Elsewhere in Canada, floods and wildfires can also have impacts on the state and accessibility of goods
movement infrastructure. This may result in goods not arriving at their destinations, or changes in
supply chains to other modes which can increase costs and/or the time it takes for goods to reach their
destinations.
Overall, climate change in Canada can have a severe negative impact on the country’s overall economic
vitality, as well as negatively impacting the population and their ability to access goods for affordable
prices, or at all in certain regions. Some strategies to help mitigate the negative impacts on residents
and the economy that can be employed by planners include ensuring that roads are built using more
heat-tolerant pavements; incentives and/or taxes to reduce gas consumption with the use of electric
vehicles; expanding drainage capacity for infrastructure; increasing maintenance activities such as
clearing debris from culverts to reduce flooding, and clearing snow to preserve permafrost and ice
stability; and changing infrastructure design requirements to include climate change considerations.

Case studies and exercises

This section presents four case studies and five self-directed exercises. The case studies present realworld examples of goods movement, while the exercises are meant to test knowledge acquired. The
topics of the case studies relate to supply chains, urbanization and land use, policy-making, and regional
project planning. The topics of the exercises relate to supply chain illustration, distribution
centre/warehouse development, goods movement policy-making, and strategic and network planning.

4.1

Case Study 1: Supply chain – Apple iPad 145 146 147

Case study concepts include competition, organization of supply chain, outsourcing, international trade,
just-in-time, last-mile delivery, advantages, and challenges.
This first case study provides a simple example of how Apple’s iPad supply chain functions. Apple has a
competitive advantage against most other companies for sourcing components for its products, as it can
place orders so large that backlogs operations of the supplier, eliminating the possibility of any other
company of placing orders due to lack of supply. This dominance has resulted in Apple’s reputation for
having the world’s best supply chain. This supply chain involves four primary steps and a fifth additional
step of reverse logistics: sourcing, manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, and return. The supply
chain is spread across multiple countries including Singapore, Taiwan, China, the U.S. and some
European nations. Figure 4.1.1 is a simple illustration of the supply chain, not including modes.
Apple purchases raw materials and components from various sources and has them shipped to an
assembly plant in China. After the products are assembled and ready for market, they are shipped to
warehousing or distribution facilities (located primarily in China and the U.S., with others in the Czech
Republic, Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom), and then either directly to consumers who
purchase online, or to retail stores. When the product’s life comes to an end, it can be returned to a
retail store, where the process of reverse logistics is initiated and the product is recycled.
In addition to Apple’s competitive advantage in sourcing products, there are also other advantages to its
supply chain. Apple has fewer key vendors compared to other companies like Amazon for example,
allowing them to work closely with these vendors and increasing the potential for favourable pricing. In
addition, Apple owns only one warehouse facility, located in Elk Grove, California, allowing costs to
remain low and not permitting the company to hold large amounts of unsold inventory at any given
time. Remaining warehousing facilities are owned by carrier services like UPS and FedEx, and serve as
intermediate warehouses for Apple.
There are, however, challenges related to their supply chain. For example, Apple’s reliance on
international trade makes it susceptible to changes in the global economy and trade relations. Some of
their components are also obtained from a single source, decreasing the resilience of the overall chain.
Moreover, Apple’s performance relies heavily on the reliability of the integration of its two main modes:
sea and road organized in a just-in-time supply chain. Finally, finding suppliers who sell high volumes of
parts is another challenge, as Apple sells between approximately 43 to 71 million iPads annually,
requiring many more millions of parts for assembly.

Case Study 2: Urbanization / land planning – Winnipeg
Centreport 148 149 150

Case study concepts include land use, policy-making, strategic location, multimodal transport, local,
national, and international trade.
The second case study explores the development of Winnipeg’s freight village. CentrePort in Winnipeg is
Canada’s first and largest tri-modal 151 inland port with direct access to national and international rail,
truck, and air cargo operations. The facility covers 20,000 acres and includes the Winnipeg James
Armstrong Richardson International Airport, and houses manufacturing and assembly, warehousing and
distribution, agribusiness, food processing and packaging, and multimodal transportation-related
logistics companies, offering greenfield development space for these businesses.
The port area, before the development of the freight village, was already home to numerous freight
companies due to its location adjacent to the airport. In order to facilitate the long-term development of
the inland port and fast track investment and economic development decisions, the Government of
Manitoba passed the CentrePort Canada Act in 2010. The province was mandated to create a
Development Plan that includes comprehensive transportation, infrastructure, and land use plan for the
approximately 20,000 acres of land around the airport that the port lands occupy and was required to

74

February 2021

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

support the 24-hour operation of the airport. Finally, the Act mandated that future development plans
of planning districts or municipalities be consistent with the province’s Development Plan for the hub.
Currently, CentrePort is home to over 800 companies, and is in the process of developing a 665-acre rail
park to connect to Canadian Pacific Railway’s main line, with access also given to Canadian National
Railway and BNSF totalling international access to three Class I Railways. Other land uses on site include
a logistics park, open recreation space, airport, business park, industrial park and a residential area. The
hub has access to many domestic and international trade corridors, including the Atlantic Gateway, the
Asia-Pacific Gateway, and the Mid-Continent Trade & Transportation Corridor. There is also access to
Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, the Mediterranean, Asia, the United States and Mexico.
CentrePort is also a gateway to other ports including Thunder Bay, Montreal, Halifax, Metro Vancouver,
Prince Rupert, Houston, New Orleans, Manzanillo and Lazaro Cardenas, and faces competition from
other prairie centres such as Port Alberta and the Global Transportation Hub in Regina. Figure 4.2.1
below shows the main corridors and gateways served by CentrePort.
CentrePort is also Canada’s first foreign trade zone (FTZ), and as of 2018 there were nine across the
country. FTZs are designated regions within a country where barriers to trade such as tariffs are
substantially reduced, or eliminated and bureaucratic requirements are lowered to attract foreign
investment and international business. CentrePort’s FTZ will permit companies to defer duty and GST
payments on imported goods that are being warehoused and redistributed to the international market.

4.3

Case Study 3: Policy – MTO off-peak delivery 152 153

Case study concepts include policy-making and by-laws, last-mile and delivery, road congestion, data
collection, environmental and social impacts, role of local actors.
The third case study relates to policy, and looks at the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario’s (MTO) offpeak delivery (OPD) pilot in 2015 during the Pan/Parapan Am Games, hosted in the Greater Toronto and
Hamilton Area (GTHA). The pilot had two key objectives; to reduce traffic demand and congestion on
highways and key corridors that was anticipated as a result of delivery-related trucks and the traffic
management tools (e.g. priority high-occupancy vehicle lanes) employed to optimize travel to and from
Games venues, and to identify the potential for longer-term implementation of OPD.
MTO rolled the pilot out in two phases. The first was a small-scale pilot in Toronto’s downtown core in
August 2014, and the second phase coincided with the Games. Participants in phase one included the
City of Toronto, five carrier companies, and more than thirty businesses (customers of carriers). The
participating carriers and businesses shifted their delivery schedules to off-peak hours – between 7:00
p.m. and 6:00 a.m. To enable this, the City of Toronto exempted participants from noise by-laws, and
MTO collected data related to noise impacts, travel time, and participant’s experiences. Phase one
resulted in few noise complaints and carriers experienced some travel time savings, with two companies
saving up to one hour. Further, OPD helped to reduce fuel consumption for delivery vehicles as well as
greenhouse gas emissions.
The second phase took place during the Games and participants included forty GTHA municipalities,
sixteen carrier companies, and over 100 retail, food and grocery businesses. MTO collected data related
to deliveries diverted off-peak, noise impacts and participant experiences. The result of the pilot was the
diversion of 18,400 deliveries off-peak, the equivalent of approximately 240,000 truck vehiclekilometres travelled. Some key success factors, according to MTO, were the minimal noise impacts of
February 2021

75

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

OPD, minimal changes or costs required for businesses to participate, and a permissive regulatory
environment. Further, the success of OPD depends on sufficient uptake, which is only possible if OPD
aligns with business models and needs.
After the pilot, the Cities of Toronto and Mississauga extended their OPD schemes an extra month. The
pilot demonstrated some advantages and limitations of OPD and added to other successful OPD
experiences in Vancouver, London and New York, ultimately encouraging other areas to pilot OPD in
their jurisdictions, or to extend their OPD pilots like the Region of Peel.

Case Study 4: Regional planning – Goods movement strategic
planning in the Region of Peel 154 155 156 157 158 159

Case study concepts include planning, policy-making, regional governance, economic vibrancy, road
congestion, strategic networks, environmental and social impacts.
The final case study looks at the Region of Peel, a significant hub for freight activity in Canada. Peel is
uniquely situated directly to the west of the City of Toronto and is composed of the City of Brampton,
the Town of Caledon and the City of Mississauga. Peel is home to the Toronto Pearson International
Airport, Canada’s busiest airport in terms of freight (and passenger traffic), and the CN Brampton yard,
Canada’s largest intermodal terminal. A large portion of the Greater Toronto Area’s (GTA) goods
movement industry is located within Peel Region due to the proximity to these facilities and the
historical availability of industrial land.
The clustering of goods movement-related industries in Peel Region have led to some unique
circumstances:
•

There was an estimated daily total of $1.8 billion worth of commodities travelling to, from, and
through the region in 2014. This resulted in the highest truck volumes in North America passing
through the region on several major highways.

•

There are over 2,000 trucking companies in Peel, some large corporations and some small
businesses, each of which contributes to the economic wellbeing of the Region.

•

Four out of every nine jobs in Peel Region are within goods movement-related industries, which
creates around $29 billion in annual income and contributes 48% of all industrial and
commercial taxes within the Region.

•

Overall, goods movement contributes $49 billion to the Peel Region GDP, which accounts for
21.1% and 9.7% of the goods movement-related GDP in Ontario and Canada, respectively.

Managing this vitally important industry and its many effects on the region is essential to ensuring that
the economic benefits it creates are sustained without compromising the resident’s standard of living.
One adverse side effect of the healthy economy is the congestion seen on roadways throughout Peel
Region. Residents want to be able to travel uninterrupted within the region, but they also expect ecommerce goods to be delivered to their door within a day. The industry employs a large number of
residents but is beginning to see decreases in the available labour force. The nature of many jobs in the
industry are also beginning to change due to technological advancements like automation and robotics.
An active goods movement industry also has impacts on the safety and environment of the region.
These issues affect truck drivers, stakeholders in the industry, and the public at large.
To properly manage the freight movement in the region, a 2012-2016 Goods Movement Strategic Plan
was developed. A 2012-2021 update was later released, with a Goods Movement Long Term Plan in
early stages of development. The strategic plans are intended as five-year blueprints to outline specific
actions that should be taken by the Region of Peel to properly manage goods movement. Although the
plans are designed for a five-year time period, they address both current problems and the Region’s
long-term vision for goods movement. Considerable stakeholder consultation was required for the
development of these policy documents, in addition to the data analysis and research required to
properly define the action items. Combined, the original and updated strategic plans outline thirty-two

action items that the Region should complete before the end of 2021. These action items can be seen in

Peel Region has been active in achieving these action items within the designated time period. The
action items represent a collection of studies, projects, and initiatives that take varying amounts of
resources, both time and money, to complete. These items were tailored to improve specific issues

78

identified in the region, some of which are regional problems and others are larger in scale. One notable
action item that has been achieved is the implementation of the Smart Freight Centre, a goods
movement centre of excellence created as a partnership between the Region and academic institutions
to conduct evidence-based research and obtain decision advocacy to coordinate transportation
infrastructure, land development, regulations, technology, tools, and resources. The regional council
approved the establishment of the Smart Freight Centre as they recognized the influence of goods
movement on the economic and social wellbeing of the region. Various other action items, including the
off-peak delivery pilot and an analysis of e-commerce trends in the region, are being achieved through
the Smart Freight Centre.
The Region has also designated a strategic goods movement network as directed in the 2012-2016
Goods Movement Strategic Plan. This project was completed to optimize the use of existing
infrastructure and minimize the impact of the additional vehicular capacity occupied by freight. In order
to develop this strategic network, the technical review examined best practices, land use, planning
policies, current truck route networks, volumes, truck origins and destinations, and overall network
connectivity. This project relied heavily on the results of the regional Road Characterization Study which
classified six types of roadways that exist in the region: rural roads, industrial connectors, suburban
connectors, commercial connectors, rural main streets, and urban main streets. The Region used various
types of roads, including provincial and municipal roads, to compose the strategic goods movement
network. The various route links were designated as either strategic truck routes, primary truck routes,
or connector truck routes, with varying levels of accommodation for freight vehicles. The strategic goods
movement network is shown in Figure 4.4.1.
Peel Region has invested a significant amount of effort into goods movement strategic planning. The
region can be used as a good example of the development and implementation of a regional/municipal
goods movement program. As outlined in this case study, it is important to compliment the other
various transportation studies and plans in any goods movement planning. This holistic approach will
ensure that the key objectives of a region are not lost in goods movement related initiatives.

Self-directed exercises

4.5.1

Illustration of a supply chain

Pick your favourite household product and describe its supply chain. You can find inspiration in the
example of Apple’s iPads presented in Case Study 1. In your example, describe its sources and origins of
raw material, all steps in the supply chain, transport modes involved, advantages and challenges.

4.5.2

Development of a distribution centre / warehouse

Scenario: Amazon wants to open a fulfillment centre in your region/municipality.
What do you need to consider in order to determine if this is viable, desirable, and an economically and
environmentally sound decision? In your example, describe its land use and space requirements, logistic
organization, the main clients, its location, and its integration in Amazon’s global scheme of distribution.

4.5.3

Goods movement policymaking

Scenario: There is a corridor within your region/municipality with high volumes of trucks, and resident
opposition to trucking and the various effects it has on the immediate community. You have a limited
ability to make any infrastructure changes, and major investments in infrastructure upgrades are not an
option.
What types of policy options are at your disposal, and how would you assess which one(s) to use?
Provide examples of policies that you would implement in order to alleviate the concerns of area
residents.

4.5.4

Strategic plan for regional goods movement

Scenario: Your region/municipality has been tasked with the development of a five-year Goods
Movement Strategic Plan.
What types of action items should be included in this plan? What are the main challenges your
region/municipality faces in relation to freight? Who are the key stakeholders who should be consulted
for this study? In your example, try to link your action items to the challenges you have identified and to
specific stakeholders who will be affected by the action item.

4.5.5

Strategic network for regional goods movement

Scenario: After the completion of your Goods Movement Strategic Plan, your region/municipality has
decided to designate a strategic goods movement network.
What are the main origins and destinations of the goods that are being moved through your
region/municipality? Which of these origins and destinations are within your region/municipality, and
which are outside? What unique challenges will you face in designating a strategic goods movement
network? Are infrastructure upgrades necessary to improve the movement of goods in your
region/municipality, or can policy and bylaw changes alone improve overall efficiency without negatively
impacting the quality of life of your residents?

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

Glossary
Break bulk cargo – Goods that are loaded/unloaded individually, and are typically stored in bags, boxes, crates,
drums, or barrels for transport (e.g. bagged cement, steel coil, and oil and gas equipment).
Bulk cargo – Also known as general cargo, a form of commodity cargo that is transported unpackaged in large
quantities, can be liquid or dry (e.g. crude oil or gravel), and the cargo itself typically poured or dropped directly
into the receptacle used for its transport.
Carrier (service provider) – A company that transports goods for clients, by a selected mode. Carriers can be a
shipping line, railways, freight airlines or a trucking company. These companies have possession of the goods while
they are in transit.
Containerization – The use of a single, standard sized cargo container to load, transport, and unload goods.
Derived demand – The demand for goods movement is a result of the demand for other goods.
Electronic logging device (ELD) – Electronic hardware that is attached to a commercial vehicle’s engine to record
driving hours.
Foreign trade zone (FTZ) – A designated region within a country where barriers to trade such as tariffs are
substantially reduced or eliminated, and bureaucratic requirements are lowered to attract foreign investment and
international business.
Freight village – Sometimes referred to as a dry port, inland port or intermodal facility, a centrally managed
intermodal transfer point located at the nexus of multiple modes.
Goods movement – Also referred to as freight, the wide array of activities involved in transporting goods (primary,
intermediate, or finished) from producer/supplier to consumer.
Hinterland – A region lying inland from the coast, or remote rural areas far from urban centres.
Hours of service (HOS) – Regulations that govern the working hours (driving and performing other tasks) of
individuals operating commercial vehicles.
Industry – Goods movement industries are categorizations of inputs of production for the output of an
intermediate or final product, to be used in other industries. Industries produce the commodities that other
industries use by adding value to raw materials or assembling multiple intermediate goods. Industries are classified
by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), six-digit codes at their most detailed level, and
divided into twenty larger sectors by the first two-digits.
Instrument flight rules – The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Instrument Flying Handbook defines IFR
as: "Rules and regulations established by the FAA to govern flight under conditions in which flight by outside visual
reference is not safe. IFR flight depends upon flying by reference to instruments in the flight deck, and navigation is
accomplished by reference to electronic signals."
Interswitching – An operation performed by railway companies (carriers) where one carrier performs the pickup of
cars from a customer (shipper) and hands off these cars to another carrier that performs the “line haul” (the
majority of the linear distance of the overall railway movement). The interswitching arrangement is made in cases
where a shipper has immediate access to a single carrier, but is within a defined distance (zone) to one or more of
the competing carriers.
Just-in-case delivery – A delivery model where businesses have large lots and inventories in anticipation of
demand. Goods are stored in warehouses for extended periods of time until orders are made. Shelves are then
restocked.

February 2021

85

Understanding Goods Movement in Canada: Trends and Best Practices

Just-in-time delivery – A delivery model that involves the suppression of stock in warehouses, low inventories in
stores, a fragmentation of shipments, fast turnaround times in production areas and distribution centres, and
coordination between industries, modes, and carriers. It is a truck and resource extensive model that requires
integration between many productive units; overall, this model results in a made-to-order system with minimal
stock levels and lower warehousing costs than just-in-case delivery.
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) – A classification system used in Canada, the United
States, and Mexico to identify businesses by their type of economic activity, or industry.
Off-peak delivery (OPD) – An urban freight strategy that aims to alleviate congestion and road conflicts caused by
deliveries during peak periods, by moving them to off-peak periods, usually between seven p.m. and six a.m.
Sector – Commodities can be raw materials or primary agricultural products (e.g. timber, copper, halibut, etc.) or
intermediate or finished goods (e.g. electronics, motorized vehicle parts, pharmaceuticals, etc.). Most often,
commodities are used as inputs in the production of finished goods and are classified by Standard Classification of
Transported Goods (SCTG) five-digit codes. The first two digits of the codes group the commodities into forty-two
Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System-based categories.
Shipper (service user) – The person or company who is usually the supplier or owner of the goods that will be
shipped. They enter into contracts with carriers and provide them with goods to transport or arrange for and
coordinate the shipment of goods to reach their chosen market.
Standard Classification of Transported Goods (SCTG) – A classification system used in Canada and the United
States to classify commodities based on transportation characteristics, commodity similarities, and industry-oforigin considerations.
Supply chain – The sequence of processes involved in the production and distribution of a commodity.
Third-party logistics provider (3PL) – A specialist in logistics who may provide a variety of transportation,
warehousing, and logistics related services to buyers or sellers. These are tasks that are often performed in-house,
but can be outsourced in certain cases.
Transloading – The process of intermodal container transfer from ships to trains or trucks, or vice-versa, by cranes.
Twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) – A unit of cargo capacity to describe the capacity of container ships and
terminals based on the volume of 20-foot-long intermodal containers. A 40-foot-long intermodal container is
equivalent to two TEUs.
Urban consolidation centre (UCC) – A logistics facility located in close proximity to a city centre, or any kind of
dense commercial area, from which consolidated deliveries are carried out and in which a range of other valueadded retail and logistics services are provided.
